It's busy and popular in Minca, so it's definitely worth checking out. You can choose from Mexican to Asian cuisine, and both were delicious.Slide 1 of 8Visited Lazy Cat while visiting Minca with the family from the States. I read of this place while I was doing some research. At first I thought it was only a burger restaurant but they have much more. Andrea was our server and she was great and very attentive. Definitely stop here. I highly recommend the ceviche!KD San \u2014 Google reviewIt is a nice and not too expensive place to go. They offer hamburgers, wraps, sandwiches, steaks and vegan food. Additionally, the have natural juices and lemonades.

The burger fell apart a bit, though taste wise it was fine.\n\nThe margaritas were outstanding as was rhe barmaid that glanced for approval.\nThe mojitos are average - I'd recommend going to KHITAJO GASTROBAR for a fab mojito + their mincacao is divine.\n\nNice background music.Carl Mendes \u2014 Google reviewFantastic menu with lots of different tastes - THAT ALL WERE GREAT. You can choose from mexican to asian cuisine and way more.

It is to be noted that I was given a choice from three bottles of various red wine - on three price levels each being 10000 COP in difference\u2026 which I think to be superb giving the diner a choice in that circumstance. The pizza was a good size for a medium and enough that I took half away with me. Super experience and great taste!Stirling Vagabond \u2014 Google reviewNice restaurant with great food. We had dinner twice at this place, once pizza and one time the ribs. Price is pretty decent.\n\nPizza was pretty nice, and after half a pizza I was already full.

The maracuya juice was delicious! We asked a pizza that wasn\u2019t on the card and they love to experience. I recommend!Sana Chantor \u2014 Google reviewVery good rating on google so we decided to give it a try. Dishes were very good size, and a medium pizza is enough for two people while a large is good for 3. The pasta were flavorful, and large but sauce tasted a bit watery. Serv\u00ed e was quick and attentive, and we had the whole upper floor to ourselves. Not the cheapest option in town. Oh also, the chicken fajita on the menu is just a burrito, so don't expect anything different. Overall, really good dinner.samuel dean \u2014 Google reviewVery surprised as my partner is Italian and have high standards I guess - super tasty pastas! Pumpkin tortellini with sorrentino tomato sauce and the Ariabiata spaghetti both really good. Come with garlic bread to soak up sauce.

We had the ribs and the picanha there. They provided us with an included starter which was very nice. The ribs were perfect, very tender and the sauce was delicious! The picanha was also very good, it was a tender and juicy piece of meat.\nThe place located next to a river, so when you go there for dinner better carry some repellent as the mosquitos will eat you.

The customer service is fantastic and the waitstaff are very friendly. The restaurant appears small from the outside, but it can seat several people comfortably.Slide 1 of 3Yummm- came here by recommendation for their sweet crepes. I tried the Nutella with banana + ice cream and was glad. The portion is quite large for a dessert so it's shareable or you could just eat it as a meal like I did. The place appears small from the outside but it could sit quite a few people. The staff was really friendly and they have English or Spanish menu.Lucy \u2014 Google reviewAn absolute gem of a place in Minca. We headed there for the 5pm-7pm happy hour with $10000  burgers and $5000 cups of wine.\n\nThat burger was sitting between a couple of clouds of deliciousness. Never have I had such a fresh burger bun before. It was served with a handful of freshly cut chips and the wine was absolutely perfect.\n\nCustomer service was top notch and we had a great night.

One of the best food we had on our travel. They deserve more crowd. We highly recommend this place. And this comes from two chefs from London. Well done \ud83d\ude0aElena Smileva \u2014 Google reviewWorst meal of our lives. Horrible service and attitude...wait staff rolling eyes. Asked specifically for patacones and they gave us fried sweet banana, ordered a bacon burger and came with no bacon, asked for no milk or cheese with my mushrooms and they served me raw undercooked mushrooms submerged in cheesy watery soup, the chicken seemed as if they microwaved it. Overcharged for the tiny portion. Addressed the issue and there was no apologies. Got diarrea after. Not sure if the people staffing at the moment were the owners but whoever was there were non-shalant and careless, did not welcome us and despite the basic request from the menu they decided to make whatever they felt like rather than acknowledging what was on the description of our order. Would not recommend this place for anyone.Hanna Casta?eda \u2014 Google reviewWe wanted food to go and the chef came out to talk to us about all the options. We ended up getting chicken and cheese sandwiches with mushrooms cooked in wine-so tasty!

Its a very beautiful hostel, the views of Minca and Santa Marta are incredible. It seemed to be doing great business as we wanted to extrnd our stay but it was booked out! The staff are amazing, I only got one of their names Tanya who was the front desk was really nice and helpful. The owner Stefan was so sound and we had great chats.\n\nThe atomsphere of the place seems very open minded and free. All the food in the restaurant is vegetarian and loads of vegan options. The food was amazing.\n\nYou must climb a relatively steep hill to get up there so please be aware of this, but it means that you get the best views of the sunset.\n\nTheres also yoga studio and spa treatments which i should have availed of.\n\nLastly, theres kittens there at the moment and they are ADORABLE.\n\nAll of these factors made it probably my favourite hostel ive stayed in!!! Thanks for the stay \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9aConnie Colgan \u2014 Google reviewLOVED my stay here, did not want to leave. I booked Casa Luna for 3 nights, which is in the far back with it's own private shower and bathroom, so my experience with the room may be different than those who stayed in dorms/hammocks but I found the room very comfortable and clean. I had plenty of space and the outdoor bathroom was super clean, as were the communal bathrooms by reception. The vibe here is amazing, everyones gathers on the deck for sunsets and it's a great chance to meet other travelers. Food was great, I had breakfast here everyday and dinner twice and beers are cheap. You can't beat the views and the music was always perfect. They cut the music around 9pm so it's easy to go to bed early. The hike up the hill to get there isn't easy but it's doable and worth it. I liked that this hostel was up in the hills but didn't require a moto taxi to get to from town. The staff was amazing at this hostel and I even got a massage and facial from Melissa, highly recommend! If you're not into bugs, don't stay here, but if you want an incredible experience in Minca and are looking to meet others I cannot recommend Casa Loma enough.Colleen McCreesh \u2014 Google reviewThe view is spectacular! I would just book a room here to see the amazing sunsets here!\nI didn't stay here, but i did enjoyed some lovely sunsets here.\nThey also have live music here, yoga in the morning and a very good vegetarian menu.\nThe hike upthere is quiet difficult, but soooo worth it!Marije Van Neck \u2014 Google reviewThis is a special place for those active travelers who are looking for a relaxing reprieve from the cities. It's a steep 450 meter (1/4 mile) climb from the road, but you arrive to stunning views of the mountains, Santa Marta, and ocean below. The elevation provides access to a nice breeze and the vibe is a relaxed yoga atmosphere with shared reading spaces and communal areas to mingle with other travelers.\nThe rooms are rustic. You don't come here to hang out in your room. You come here to lounge in the open air spaces and simply sleep in the room. We had a double bed hut. The bug netting was clean and adequate to protect from the bugs. The bed was comfy and clean. The shared toilets are well lit and surprisingly clean.Jesse Sellars \u2014 Google reviewWe really enjoyed our stay at Casa Loma. The food and views were excellent. The hike up wasn\u2019t too tough. Tania helped us so much when we were there as we had to moves rooms a few times due to us booking separate nights.

I would especially like to mention my gratitude to the amazing staff.\n\nUnfortunately I don't remember all the names of the amazing staff, that worked there. The ones I kept in my brain were Jeremias and Ray, who did an outstanding Job at the bar. Always friendly and up for a nice chat.\n\nAlso Guillermo was amazing. After a couple of days he made me feel at home and it felt like a true friendship. Thanks for the moments and conversations galactic brother.\n\nI am very happy to have stayed in casa Loma. Especially nice was the atmosphere with the staff. It did not feel, that they would just work there, it felt that I visit their home. So much passion, customer service and honesty. Please don't change! I will always keep this place and you in my heart.Max B. \u2014 Google reviewThis place is very beautiful, however, I would recommend staying somewhere else and just coming for sunset and drinks as the rooms are not worth the money. The vibe is cool but it was very hard to sleep at night - as you are outside there is a lot of bugs, they blasted music until 4am whilst I was there and then staff were speaking very loudly outside the dorm at 7:30am.\n\nPros:\nVeggie food good and reasonably priced\nDrinks reasonable too\nSetting and sunset is amazing\n\nCons:\nBeds are expensive and very basic\nSteep uphill climb to get to it, which was really horrible with our bags\nRooms are very basic/outdoors which is fine but it\u2019s really loud at night\nAmenities could be improvedFredie Sharp \u2014 Google reviewcalle 1 #No 5, Minca, Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia\u2022https://hotels.cloudbeds.com/reservation/bUfRkK15RESTAURANTE ASADERO CAMARITASaveSlide 1 of 44.4(100)\u20224.5(8)RestaurantSlide 1 of 3Magical experience and best food in Minca.Tom Tenney \u2014 Google reviewI was probably the only foreigner in this restaurant.

My plate did not have potatoes like offered in the menu, the waiter said they are out of stock. After complaining they brought me potatoes within 2 minutes. I paid more than offered in the menu.

It\u2019s highly popular with travelers due to its relaxed atmosphere, beautiful landscapes and excellent hostels. However, many visitors don\u2019t have weeks to enjoy chilling out in the village, so here\u2019s a quick guide on how to make the most of 48 hours in Minca.          View All Trips        Arriving at lunchtime from Santa Marta, the first thing to do is grab a bite to eat in town, and there\u2019s nowhere better to do that than at The Lazy Cat, a great little restaurant just opposite the village church, which overlooks the river and serves the best burgers and burritos in town. Then wander across the bridge towards Cafe Minca for a local coffee. Even if you\u2019re not staying there, the adjacent Hotel Minca is worth a visit to enjoy their amazing hummingbird feeders, which attract an array of the colorful little birds.

The best place in town to stay is the delightful Casa Loma Hostel, which is perched on a hillside above the village and commands amazing views over the distant Caribbean Sea and the gorgeous green mountains. Check in here, order a delicious vegan dinner for the evening, then spend the rest of your first day relaxing, enjoying the view and waiting for the sunset. Casa Loma has the best sunset views in town, and there\u2019s even a great happy hour to make the evening pass even quicker. Get an early night, because there\u2019s a lot to do tomorrow.     Wake up nice and early (it\u2019s much cooler and fresher in the morning), and head down into Minca to grab a mototaxi up into the mountains to La Victoria Coffee Farm. This working coffee farm is one of the oldest in Colombia and offers a fascinating glimpse at the old machinery once used to harvest the magic little beans, which is still in use today! Take the tour at La Victoria in the morning, then stick around for lunch to enjoy one of their delicious sandwiches and an ice cold Happy Toucan Beer, which is also brewed on site. After lunch, walk back towards Minca from the farm along the road towards Pozos Naturales (grab another mototaxi if you\u2019re not the hiking type).                                  CARIBBEAN COLOMBIA         Discover Colombia\u2019s Caribbean coast, from Cartagena to Palomino via jungles, rivers and islands.   View Trip            Coffee drying at La Victoria in Minca | \u00a9 Chris Bell / The Culture Trip                Pozos Naturales is a lovely little swimming hole on the river between La Victoria and Minca, and is the perfect place to enjoy a refreshing dip in the cooling waters of the Sierra Nevada (don\u2019t forget to pack your bathing suit when you leave in the morning). There are many stalls along the road from the Pozos to Minca, where you can sample local chocolate and honey products, and enjoy the mountain views. Always keep an eye out for Toucans as well: they are commonly seen along this road. Grab some dinner in Minca \u2013 you\u2019re forgiven if you choose The Lazy Cat again \u2013 and head back up to Casa Loma: there\u2019s still the happy hour to look forward to!     On your final morning, rise nice and early and meet up with Jungle Joe down in the village \u2013 he offers excellent beginner\u2019s birding tours on the trails around the village and is the perfect man with whom to discover the feathered joys of the Santa Marta Mountains. You can see toucans, parrots, owls, woodpeckers and much more with Joe, and he\u2019s a patient and understandable guide. You\u2019ll be finished by 9:30 am, which gives you a couple more hours to enjoy: hop on a quick mototaxi and head to Marinka Waterfalls to enjoy a last cooling dip in the river, before you head back down the mountains to the sweltering heat of the coast.

It\u2019s a small town with plenty to do!Scroll down to see a map of all mentioned places.EatDuni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuni is a cafe serving a full breakfast and lunch menu, as well as homemade breads and ice cream, in a beautiful space. Get here early for your pick of their homemade breads, and definitely enjoy a meal if you have time. Everything was fresh, delicious, and thoughtfully presented. If you\u2019re feeling decadent, go for their chocolate bread french toast. The staff is lean and service can be a little slow, so it\u2019s definitely a place to sit and relax. La Miga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother cafe with delicious breads and coffees. The chocolate bread at La Miga, which is very different from Duni\u2019s version, was so good. We saw some people ordering sandwiches, but breads and coffee seem to be their main thing. When we were there, they were offering generous samples at the counter. On Google Maps this is called \u201cCrumb Bakery.\u201dSailor Will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSailor Will was on our way to our hostel, so we stopped in for lunch right after we got off the colectivo from Santa Marta. The space was beautiful, the staff was really friendly, and we could see the small kitchen from our table. We shared the menu del dia, which was a big portion of rice, meat, plantains, avocado, and beans. We didn't get pictures of the food, but obviously plenty of pictures of the Club Colombias we washed our meal down with.El Bistro de la Victoria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEl Bistro de la Victoria is the restaurant attached to Finca Victoria (more on that below). After a very steep hike up to the coffee farm, we were so happy to sit down at the Bistro with a couple of cold beers and sandwiches before our coffee tour. The sandwiches were huge and we probably could have shared one. Nevada Cerveceria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beers we drank at El Bistro de la Victoria are from Nevada Cerveceria, the brewery right next door to the coffee farm. You can only find their beers in a few places in this region, so I recommend trying them if you come across them. We had the pilsner and really liked it, and if you\u2019re judging a book by its cover, the labels are pretty cool. Casa Loma\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nCasa Loma, the hostel we stayed at served homemade vegetarian breakfast, lunch, and dinner at reasonable prices. We ate dinner there both nights of our stay, and some people who weren\u2019t even staying at the hostel came for the meal (it\u2019s about a 10-minute hike uphill from town, which should say something!). Each night there\u2019s one appetizer, entree, and dessert on the menu, which is posted on a chalkboard that morning so you can decide if you want to sign up. The food is individually plated and served at the shared tables where you can get to know your fellow travelers. Both our dinners were delicious with generous portions and high-quality ingredients. Lazy CatWe didn\u2019t get to try Lazy Cat, right across from Sailor Inn, but we heard from multiple people that while eating on the outdoor deck, a Toucan stopped by, ate some fries, and flew away. Sounds worth it just for that!DoSunset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sunsets in Minca are beautiful. Get up to any high point and watch the sun go down and the sky change colors in between the mountains. We watched the sunset from the sunset deck at our hostel both nights. Like the dinners, many people come up to Casa Loma just for that. Pozo Azul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s about a 45-minute hike up the road from town before a 15-minute walk down the path to Pozo Azul, a swimming hole. The first swimming hole was packed. We crossed this area (you have to walk through the water, so we had to take our socks and sneakers off and then put them back on) and hiked up to the second swimming hole, which was less crowded and a bit deeper. We watched teenage boys jump off the high cliff before we jumped off a slightly lower cliff :). We hiked just a little bit farther up to another swimming hole that was virtually empty, where we sat and read for a bit. There are no amenities here, save for a couple ladies grilling plantains at the entrance, so come prepared. Finca Victoria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe debated hiking up to Finca Victoria from Pozo Azul or taking a moto-taxi but ultimately walked up and took a moto-taxi back down. This hike up is very steep and challenging, but with beautiful views. We speed-walked (as much as we could uphill) and it took us 50 minutes from the start of the path to Pozo Azul. We started with lunch at the restaurant attached to the farm (see above) before our tour. There\u2019s no tour schedule, they just take you around whenever you\u2019re ready, maybe waiting to see if a couple more people show up. The tour costs $15,000 pesos and includes a cup of their coffee. La Victoria has been around since 1892 and uses water and gravity to power their automatic production of coffee beans. It\u2019s pretty impressive and we learned a lot from our knowledgeable tour guide.Chill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially if you\u2019re coming to Minca from a big city, this is a good time to relax. Life seems pretty laid-back here, and our hostel was a great place to catch up on reading, play cards, and take in the views while surrounded by nature.Moto-taxiAs mentioned, we took a moto-taxi back to our hostel from Finca Victoria. Look for the guys in black polos with blue writing; these are the official Minca moto-taxi drivers. It\u2019s a fun experience, just hold on tight!  We were only in Minca for two nights so didn\u2019t get to do everything. Here are a few other activities we read about on the blog Practical Wanderlust: Las PiedrasLas Cascadas de MarinkaFinca La CandelariaShoppingStayCasa Loma Minca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were really happy with our decision to stay at Casa Loma. As I mentioned a couple times above, people who aren\u2019t even sleeping there come up for meals and the sunset because they have so much to offer. They have a number of different types of accommodations including private rooms, open-air huts, dorms, hammocks, and tents. We chose the Casa Luna hut for its views and its private bathroom (the only one offered). This hut is secluded from the rest of the camp and has a wide open view of the mountains, plus the night sky full of stars - something you don\u2019t get in New York City! The shower has the same view, which was pretty amazing. The hut has a mosquito net over the bed and a big wooden locker, which we put all our stuff in when not using, including toiletries, for security and to keep animals away. The hut has a curtain in lieu of a door, and the noises we heard in the night took some getting used to, but waking up and going to bed with that view was worth it. Even though we stayed in the secluded hut with our own bathroom, we took advantage of the benefits of staying in a hostel, such as group dinners and meeting other travelers. We enjoyed sitting in the hammocks and at the picnic tables in the main lodge playing cards and reading. If you can manage the hike up to Casa Loma from town, I recommend booking a room here!EAT AND DO IN MINCA - MAP VIEW\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nALL COLOMBIA BLOG POSTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2019\n\n\n\nColombia, Minca, Minca activities, To Do\n\n\n\nVisiting Minca, Colombia\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2019\n\n\n\nColombia, Minca, Minca activities, To Do\n\n\nOn my recent trip to Colombia with my sister, we spent a couple nights in Minca, which is in the mountains a few hours north of Cartagena.

It\u2019s a great place to stay before you head to Tayrona National Park or the beaches up the coast like Palomino. It is where you can rest and relax before the Ciudad Perdida (The Lost City)\u00a0or if you just want to take a break from Santa Marta. Minca Colombia is also finding its purpose and building its own reputation as an ecotourism destination.\n\nWhere is Minca Colombia?\u00a0\nMinca is a 45-minute drive from Santa Marta. Sometime this area is known as Minca Santa Marta, but correctly its Minca Magdalena as its part of the Magdalena department. It is a pleasant drive up a windy and circular 600 meter climb up the mountains of Sierra Nevada Colombia. The ride going up is scenic with views that eventually lead to spectacular vistas of Santa Marta and the ocean at the distance. You will just have to put up with the narrow, two-lane road, which is somewhat harrowing when traffic is coming from the other direction. The bonus is that the road is also paved in the last few years so that makes for an enjoyable trip.\nMinca\u2019s Transformation\nThe common question we are asked is, \u201cIs Minca safe?\u201d\u00a0 Minca was originally guerilla territory and was closed off to everyone, except locals. Following the ceasefire by the paramilitary and guerilla groups over the last several years, Minca was only recently \u2018discovered\u2019 by backpackers in the last eight years and was eventually opened up to host visitors. It\u2019s not just a place for backpackers either because it has something for everyone (even mid-life travelers like us). And the answer to your question, not once have we heard any issues or concerns about safety in Minca Magdalena.\n\nThings to do in Minca\nHiking\nNot only are there tonnes of things to do in Minca Colombia, there are ample hiking trails in the area. We decided to do the Los Pinos trail to get a whole perspective of the village and area. This is a three-hour (one way) hike uphill or a six-hour walk if you want to take this circular trail back to town that ends on the opposite end of the main street. To start this trail, exit the main street at the alternate direction past burger town, past the soccer fields, and further into the village. You will see waterfalls, birds, and forests on the way up. When you reach the cloud forest and the Dos Pinos or \u201cTwo Pines\u201d, you get a welcome view from the top of the Sierra Nevada mountains. We recommend taking the walk up, then relaxing at Casa Elemento (at the top), and take a moto-taxi down back to Minca. This will cut your trip down to three hours, plus the views are best on the way up.\n\nOne of many draw dropping views around Minca\n\n\nDiscover Minca\u2019s Interesting History\u00a0\nVisit Minca\u2019s museum and memorial center. (Centro de Memoria de la Sierra Nevada) Take a guided tour through this nonprofit center learn about its evolution from the armed conflict and political history, its importance as a coffee region and the indigenous groups of the Sierra Nevadas. Now rated the #1 for the \u00a0 things to do in Minca on Trip Advisor, check out the great reviews!\u00a0\n\nTravelers taking the guided tour of the museum\nRelax and spend the afternoon at Casa Elemento\nWhat more could you ask for? It has a restaurant, bar, pool, climbing wall and a giant hammock to hang over the mountain and contemplate on how great your life is while you look down at a stunning view of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This is our top Minca things to do thing. No doubt there will be other travelers from all over the world to hang out and join you. This an ideal place to chill out which takes your present-moment living to the next level. This place is a calming oasis. They also organize tours. \u00a0They charge a small the entrance fee, (at the time of booking it was 10,000 COP) and you can already spend the afternoon there to use their facilities or you can stay there! Check latest prices and availability here. \u00a0\nVisit La Victoria Coffee Farm\nEven if you\u2019ve had your fill of coffee farms by now, this tour is different. In fact, the place is the production facility and not an actual farm. (The coffee is in the hills surrounding the building) This is where their coffee is processed by traditional equipment and methods from the late 1800\u2019s and early 1900\u2019s. The delightful tour guides will be ready to take you through the buildings, and share some of the ingenious engineering methods they apply to produce modern-day coffee, using equipment that is a big step back in time.\nHang out in one of the many restaurants and caf\u00e9s\nAt the center of the village, there is also a couple of pool halls for travelers to drink and connect with the local village men. For such a small town there is no shortage of places to eat and drink. Here are some of the cool little hangout spots all over the town.\n\nGreat bar, restaurant and cafe close to the town center.\nOther honorable mentions of what to do in Minca Colombia include:\nBird watching\nThere are over 162 species of birds in the area of Minca, so it is not surprising that bird watching is an important pastime here. There are tours available to El Dorado and San Lorenzo trails or birdwatching areas. For three hours, it is around COP$25,000 ($8USD).\nPozo Azul Minca\nDid we mention that it\u2019s hot up in the Northern Caribbean? Although the Minca breeze is a welcome reprieve from Cartagena or Santa Marta, you may still want to cool down after a day of walking. Pozo Azul is a watering hole, not the drinking kind. On Sundays, it is full of local families, so we skipped this one. Who doesn\u2019t like a good place to have a cold, refreshing dip? The entrance to Pozo Azul Minca is free. One of the many local moto-taxi drivers would be more than happy to take you there for the afternoon. The cost is around 7000COP ($2.30USD) to get there from the main street.\u00a0\n\nSimple yet relaxing place to cool down and hang out \u2013 Pozo Azul\n\nPozo Azul Minca \u2013 Up close and personal with nature\nStrapped for time? Book a Day Trip to Minca\u00a0\nSometimes time really isn\u2019t on your side, you can book a daytrip or overnight from Santa Marta and have the whole day organized and planned for you, book on line and give yourself freedom with Get Your Guide.\n[tcb-script async=\u201d\u201d defer=\u201d\u201d src=\u201dhttps://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\u201d][/tcb-script]\nMap of Things to Do In Minca\n\nDetailed map of things to do in Minca\nWhere to Stay in Minca: \nThere is no shortage of places to stay in Minca Colombia and we\u2019ve stayed in a number of them now. Here are our favorites that are well worth it.\u00a0\n1) Casa Loma Minca Hostel\nMinca accomodation has grown big time! One of the popular spots is\u00a0Hostal Casa Loma Minca, an awesome part Minca hostel and a rustic cabin with both dorm and private rooms. We loved our stay in the Casa Selva room; it\u2019s like a tent cabin (or rustic forest hut, as they call it), with comfortable bed and a long lock box to protect your valuables. The dinners here are sensational \u2013 hearty vegetarian dishes like Vegetable Curry and Vegetarian Lasagna. Important note: It\u2019s a steep climb before you arrive at the Casa, so you may want to consider leaving all your gear in Santa Marta. But once you get there, you will witness some of the grandest views looking across the mountains. The cold beer at the top is worth it. There is a range of charming accommodations from dorms to tree cabins, and all reasonably priced. Check here for the prices and availability at Casa Loma\u00a0\n\nView of Santa Marta above from the viewpoint at Casa Loma\n\nOne of the many cool rooms \u2013 tent cabins at Casa Loma\u00a0\n2) Minca Ecohabs\nFor a little more pampering, Ecohabs Minca are stilted rustic cabins that are very tastefully decorated and with views overlooking the mountains. We toured the rooms and grounds for a future stay as we didn\u2019t book here. But these come highly recommended by tour companies we work with, and they seem open to negotiating room rates. Click here for prices and availability at Minca Ecohabs.\n\nThe cool cabins at Minca Ecohabs \u2013 many hang over a cliff with awesome views\n\n3) Casa Elemento Minca\nCasa Elemento really does have everything and its known for the biggest Colombian hammock overlooking Sierra Nevada Colombia. We\u2019ve eaten here and spent the day here. * Keep in mind, its way up the hill of the Sierra Nevada mountains so you will need to get transport to get there from the main street in town.There are many options for accommodations include dorms, cabanas, and hammocks, and now a newer set of cabanas all facing the mountain views. Check here for prices and availability at Casa Elemento\n\nCheck out this view from the \u00a0Casa Elemento Minca cabins\u00a0\n3)\u00a0Casa del Pozo Azul\u00a0\nThis is one of those places where you feel truly in nature and the jungle. It\u2019s just 2 km up the hill and right beside the Pozo Azul Minca watering hole. There are lovely accomodations surrounded by trees and a babbling river, its super serene and a true escape. \u00a0Check prices and availability here.\n\nCasa del Pozo Azul in the jungle\nRecommended Restaurants and Caf\u00e9s\u00a0\n1) Casa Elemento\nThis place is great not just for a brief retreat, but also a place to stop for excellent food. During our time there, our Canadian friend was the chef there, we hope the food is still as good as it was for us. Here is a photo of the shepard\u2019s pie and salad. \u00a0And you can stay there too! Check pricing and details here for Casa Elemento Minca.\u00a0\n\n2) Restaurant Santisabella\nThis is a really good \u00a0Italian food joint. The chef here has some classical training, which is evident in the thin crust pizza and fresh made pasta and lasagna. Be prepared to wait, as it is all made from scratch. You can find this place by heading to the police station; turn left head up the hill till you see this tree house-style spot on the left.\u00a0\n\n3) Burger Town\nThese are not fast food burgers. They are hand crafted, juicy, BBQ\u2019d burgers made by an Argentinian chef. The burgers come with fries on the side, as well as several choices of dipping sauces.\u00a0\n\n4) Caf\u00e9 de Minca\nWe had excellent cappuccinos, fresh juices and breakfast sandwiches here. It\u2019s also a store with artisan jewelry, as well as homemade hot sauces and condiments. This is the mainstay cafe in Minca.\n\n5) Cocina de Campo Caf\u00e9 and Hostel\nThis place is on the way to Pozo Azul and beside the entrance to Casa Pozo Azul. Its a simple and delicious place for Menu del dia, Almuerzo(lunch) and coffee. Its also a hostal and camping area, surrounded by the jungle.\n\nTraveling Around Minca\nThere is no shortage of friendly, eager, to young Minca men who would love to take you on a moto-taxi around Minca. Distances are a quite far, so it\u2019s worth the ride. We used moto-taxis to get back down from Casa Elemento and to travel up the hill to via Victoria Coffee Farm. Head to the main edge of town near the bridge to negotiate moto taxis and cabs.\u00a0\nHow To Get to Minca: \n\n1. First, you need to get to Santa Marta: \u00a0\nFrom Cartagena and Barranquilla, there are bus services to take you to Santa Marta. From Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn, or Cali, we would recommend taking local flights, which are reasonably priced ($40USD one way at this time of booking). VivaAir discount airlines have flights. Often, Avianca airlines has seat sales. If you are coming from the Airport in Santa Marta \u2013you can take the public bus for 1800COP with the bus marked \u2018Bonda\u2019 and head into the city to the central market.\nImportant Tip:\u00a0The airport is quite a long way from the main city center. We made the mistake of getting off too early, so make sure you get off at the Centro Mercado (the Central market). The next step to get to Minca from Santa Marta that is easy.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0How to get from Santa Marta Airport to Minca:\n \nFrom Santa Marta Airport to Minca you can get there are few ways:\u00a0\n\nCatch a \u201cprivate\u201d taxi for COP$44, 000-60,000 ($14USD-19USD) per car. A private car simply means you can leave when you want with however many people on board.\nCatch a collectivo or shared taxi on the corner of Calle 11 and Carrera 12 in Santa Marta at the market (El Mercado). These types of transport should cost around COP$7000 ($2.29USD) per person. The taxi will wait until there are four people before it leaves. As far as we know, there is no Santa Marta to Minca bus\nCatch a Moto-taxi \u2013 If you have only small items to carry (like a backpack) this is a good option. You can catch a moto-taxi from central Santa Marta for $COP 8000-10,000 ($2.60USD-$3.25USD).\n\nGiven Minca to Santa Marta is so close, you can do a day trip to Minca very easily, but we think you should stay at least one night and catch the vibe there.\nTo Get To Tayrona National Park from Minca, your guesthouse can arrange for a transport there or to Santa Marta. or walk down to the main street and negotiate with a taxi to take you down. At the time of our visit there was no Minca to Tayrona bus service.\u00a0\nAlternatively if you want to get from Cartagena to Minca, or Minca to Cartagena \u2013 the bus journey is about a 5 hour journey. It will stop in Baranquilla. A good choice is Berlinas bus company, there are frequent buses leaving from the Berlinas bus terminal and it should cost around 40,000 pesos (~$14 USD). Note there are several bus stations in Cartagena so you need to specify the name.\u00a0\nHeading up to Minca Santa Marta? then you MUST do the Lost City/Ciudad Perdida Hike,\u00a0 OR If that isn\u2019t for you, then check out our Tayrona National Park Videohere!\nStill planning your trip to Colombia? \u00a0\u2013 Check out our \u00a0comprehensive guide to Colombia here and all of our posts about Colombia here.\u00a0\u200b\nAnd we really appreciate readers who have gone to Minca Magdalena and want to give us their updates and opinions.

What started off as a few days, turned into a few more & a few more again, it was just one of those places that we never wanted to leave.Being perched in the mountains meant that Minca was a welcome break from the sweltering city heat & after spending a little while in\u00a0Cartagena we were definitely in need of some cooler temperatures. We never realised before going to Minca Colombia\u00a0just how much there was to do in the area so we\u2019ve gone ahead & put together our 5 alluring reasons to add Minca Colombia to your kick-ass itinerary in the hope that we inspire you to pay this pretty little town a visit too.Note from the author:\u00a0This article has been written by me from my travel experience.

Happy reading!1) To Stay At\u00a0Casa LomaWhere to stay in Minca? Undisputedly one of the best places we have stayed on our travels Casa Loma\u00a0is just such a cool & super chilled place to hang out! A 10 minute walk up some very steep steps from Minca\u2019s tiny main square this place is a real gem & is well worth the sweaty climb up there for a number of reasons but the top one being the spectacular views!There are an array of accommodation options at\u00a0Casa Loma ranging from sleeping outside in hammocks, renting a private cabana or even bringing your own tent. We opted for the bringing our own at 15,000 COP per person per night & then went all out & upgraded on our last evening to a cabana at 85,000 COP, whatever you choose to do booking in advance for this place is advised as it can fill up very quickly.As there is no WIFI at all at\u00a0Casa Loma the vibe is somewhat different to most other hostels or guesthouses that we stayed in & this is what we really loved about it! There are plenty of areas to sit around, chill & enjoy the views, sunset being the most incredible time of the day, with the sky glowing a different shade every evening. There are also group dinners every night, all homemade, vegetarian & with 1 menu option only. We joined in with these almost every day as the food was absolutely delicious & the idea of having a family style meal meant that we could sit with other travellers & exchange travel tales over dinner & well into the night!Casa Loma\u00a0also has the added bonus of some the best staff we have ever come across, nothing was too much trouble for them & they really are a wealth of information on the local area & beyond. We even ended up booking our\u00a0Lost City Trek through them rather than travelling down to Santa Marta to arrange it & did a number of different activities in the area based on recommendations from Jay, Anne, Helena & their fabulous team!  Save  Waking up to the sounds of the jungle, Minca Colombia  Save  One shade of Casa Loma sunset, Minca Colombia  Save  Enjoying some delicious homemade veggie burgers at Casa Loma  Save  Cabanas built on the design of traditional tribal dwellings fit perfectly into the environment at Casa Loma, Minca2) For The Chilled Minca Colombia VibesWith a population of only 800 people, Minca Colombia has a real small town chilled out vibe & that\u2019s one of the reasons we loved it so much! There\u2019s not much in town at all, a church with a small square, a few bars & restaurants & just a few shops. We would highly recommend checking out the Lazy Cat for great food & cocktails & if you need it, some WIFi! The french bakery is also a great little spot & has bread & pastries that would rival any proper boulangerie.With a mix of Colombians & foreigners this rather hippy feeling town has a lot on offer in terms of zen & relaxation, there\u2019s lots of yoga in town as well as meditation classes on offer. It\u2019s also worth checking out the Cacao museum which is actually more of a shop that sells cacao in many forms but also has some interesting information on the history & health benefits of this magical plant.  Save  3) To Connect With The MountainsMinca\u2019s setting is heavenly, Colombia\u2019s Sierra Nevada is one of the world\u2019s highest coastal ranges which means it boasts spectacular views all the way down to the cities of Santa Marta & Barranquilla right to the Caribbean sea. We were absolutely blown away by the scenery, especially by the different shades of green that just seemed to pop all around us!The indigenous tribes that still live in these mountains today have a deep connection to their environment & still practice various forms of worship just as they have done for thousands of years. Mountains are definitely our thing which made Minca Colombia\u00a0extra special for us as the energy was incredible, we felt really connected with nature whilst we were there & completely & utterly away from it all!  Save  Soaking up the views after a long hike, Los Pinos Trek, Minca  Save  Even on a cloudy day the views are incredible in Minca  Save  Just breathing in the mountains at the top of Cerro Kennedy Hike from Minca  Save  Spectacular mountain views, Minca Colombia4) For The HikingLos Pinos HikeWhat do mountains mean? Hiking of course, one of our favourite things to do & something that we took full advantage of whilst we were in the area! We took on the Los Pinos trek, a loop right up into the cloud forest from Minca which took us a full day (around 8-9 hours in total) with a stop off at Cascadas Marinkas & a stop at the very highest point at Los Pinos to take in the views. Due to the terrain this hike took us longer than the 5-7 hours that we had expected, just a little tip if you are thinking of doing the same thing, give yourself enough time to enjoy the day!Cerro Kennedy HikeAnother awesome hike we did from Minca Colombia\u00a0was up to Cerro Kennedy, an overnight hike where we stayed at some very basic huts in the tiny village of San Lorenzo & woke up in the morning to hike up to the peak of Cerro Kennedy for sunrise, snow-capped views over the Sierra Nevada\u2019s highest peaks & it was jaw-dropping. This hike was a 20km, 7 hour uphill slog on day 1 then a 4:30 am rise, 3km uphill to the peak & 23km all the way back down to Minca\u00a0for day 2. There\u2019s hardly anything on route here so if you are thinking of doing this too bring everything you need with you, including food & water. The hut we stayed at cost us 35,000 COP per person & we were lucky enough that the family up there had enough food in to give us dinner for 10,000 COP per person.What we loved most about hiking in this area was the feeling of really being off the beaten track but that also meant meant we really had to think for ourselves. Doing all of these hikes without a guide, we had to make sure we had enough portable chargers with us to keep our phones topped up so that we could navigate with our trusty app\u00a0maps.me and also carried enough of everything else we needed with us. We had some real independent adventures hiking around Minca Colombia & left with experiences & memories that we will treasure for a lifetime!

The first located about an hour walk from the main village & the second around 45 mins were both great places for a nice cold dip but our favourite was definitely\u00a0Marinka. We arrived there very early in the morning, purposely before the crowds & had the whole place to ourselves, it was pretty cold swimming at 7:30 am but at the same time was so magical with just the two of us, the nature & the falls cascading all around us.We\u2019d recommend going to either of these outside of weekends & in the early morning if you are planning to visit as we\u2019ve heard they can get very busy & even polluted at times! https://www.instagram.com/p/BcIAjOgB61i/So there you have it, if getting lost in nature & breathtaking scenery are your thing we would certainly recommend adding Minca Colombia to your kick-ass itinerary!You can also check out the rest of the awesome hostels that are in Minca Colombia here.If you have any questions for us at all or anything you\u2019d like to add let us know in the comments just below please!Happy adventuring!Kelly & Adam x  Save  Minca Colombia Related Posts   Save    San Andr\u00e9s Island, Colombia \u2013 The Caribbean On A Budget!   read more    Save    Camino Real Colombia Hike \u223c An Ancient Route From Barichara to Los Santos  8 Comments  read more    Save    Cost Of Travelling Colombia \u2013 What We Spent In 52 Days  4 Comments  read more    Save    45 Awesome Photos That Will Inspire You To Travel Colombia!  2 Comments  read more    Save    7 Awesome Places To Visit In Colombia For Your Perfect Travel Itinerary   read more Pin me for later!

It's busy and popular in Minca, so it's definitely worth checking out. You can choose from Mexican to Asian cuisine, and both were delicious.Slide 1 of 8Visited Lazy Cat while visiting Minca with the family from the States. I read of this place while I was doing some research. At first I thought it was only a burger restaurant but they have much more. Andrea was our server and she was great and very attentive. Definitely stop here. I highly recommend the ceviche!KD San \u2014 Google reviewIt is a nice and not too expensive place to go. They offer hamburgers, wraps, sandwiches, steaks and vegan food.

Everything on the menu was excellent, fresh and great quality.   Many vegetarian options and large selection of beverages. The staff was very lovely and the vibe was great!

The burger fell apart a bit, though taste wise it was fine.\n\nThe margaritas were outstanding as was rhe barmaid that glanced for approval.\nThe mojitos are average - I'd recommend going to KHITAJO GASTROBAR for a fab mojito + their mincacao is divine.\n\nNice background music.Carl Mendes \u2014 Google reviewFantastic menu with lots of different tastes - THAT ALL WERE GREAT. You can choose from mexican to asian cuisine and way more.

It is to be noted that I was given a choice from three bottles of various red wine - on three price levels each being 10000 COP in difference\u2026 which I think to be superb giving the diner a choice in that circumstance. The pizza was a good size for a medium and enough that I took half away with me. Super experience and great taste!Stirling Vagabond \u2014 Google reviewNice restaurant with great food. We had dinner twice at this place, once pizza and one time the ribs. Price is pretty decent.\n\nPizza was pretty nice, and after half a pizza I was already full.

The maracuya juice was delicious! We asked a pizza that wasn\u2019t on the card and they love to experience. I recommend!Sana Chantor \u2014 Google reviewVery good rating on google so we decided to give it a try. Dishes were very good size, and a medium pizza is enough for two people while a large is good for 3. The pasta were flavorful, and large but sauce tasted a bit watery. Serv\u00ed e was quick and attentive, and we had the whole upper floor to ourselves. Not the cheapest option in town. Oh also, the chicken fajita on the menu is just a burrito, so don't expect anything different. Overall, really good dinner.samuel dean \u2014 Google reviewVery surprised as my partner is Italian and have high standards I guess - super tasty pastas! Pumpkin tortellini with sorrentino tomato sauce and the Ariabiata spaghetti both really good. Come with garlic bread to soak up sauce.

We had the ribs and the picanha there. They provided us with an included starter which was very nice. The ribs were perfect, very tender and the sauce was delicious! The picanha was also very good, it was a tender and juicy piece of meat.\nThe place located next to a river, so when you go there for dinner better carry some repellent as the mosquitos will eat you.

I tried the Nutella with banana + ice cream and was glad. The portion is quite large for a dessert so it's shareable or you could just eat it as a meal like I did.

We headed there for the 5pm-7pm happy hour with $10000  burgers and $5000 cups of wine.\n\nThat burger was sitting between a couple of clouds of deliciousness.

I had breakfast and lunch here, and everything was excellent. I love veggies but it\u2019s so hard to find a good filling and delicious salad in Colombia, but Agua de Rio delivered. The AC works too, and the decor is contemporary with a retro vibe. Super comfortable and inviting. I\u2019m finding it hard not to have all my meals here now while I\u2019m still in Santa Marta!jess m \u2014 Google reviewSanta Marta, Magdalena, Colombia\u2022http://www.aguaderio.com.co/8ArabescaSaveSlide 1 of 44.7(97)\u20224.5(39)Syrian restaurantSlide 1 of 3the experience was incredible in terms of price and quality, I recommend the mini shawarma, tabbouleh salad, manakish and the lemonades\u2661Norma de horta \u2014 Google reviewWe had a great time enjoying great authentic food and music.

Typical Colombian dishes which are well prepared for a fair price ; many of the other places are either wanna-be fancy or just have international kitchen. The terrace is also quite nice and you can observe street life whilst eating. I ate there twice during my stay and I was happy. Thanks :)Daniel Felix Volkmann \u2014 Google reviewThe food took long to get service. The fish was small, the vegetarian sandwich was so so.

It is a climb to get here but part of the experience if you didn't overpack and fit.James L \u2014 Google reviewI just wish I could have stayed longer here. Its a very beautiful hostel, the views of Minca and Santa Marta are incredible. It seemed to be doing great business as we wanted to extrnd our stay but it was booked out! The staff are amazing, I only got one of their names Tanya who was the front desk was really nice and helpful. The owner Stefan was so sound and we had great chats.\n\nThe atomsphere of the place seems very open minded and free. All the food in the restaurant is vegetarian and loads of vegan options. The food was amazing.\n\nYou must climb a relatively steep hill to get up there so please be aware of this, but it means that you get the best views of the sunset.\n\nTheres also yoga studio and spa treatments which i should have availed of.\n\nLastly, theres kittens there at the moment and they are ADORABLE.\n\nAll of these factors made it probably my favourite hostel ive stayed in!!! Thanks for the stay \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9aConnie Colgan \u2014 Google reviewLOVED my stay here, did not want to leave. I booked Casa Luna for 3 nights, which is in the far back with it's own private shower and bathroom, so my experience with the room may be different than those who stayed in dorms/hammocks but I found the room very comfortable and clean. I had plenty of space and the outdoor bathroom was super clean, as were the communal bathrooms by reception. The vibe here is amazing, everyones gathers on the deck for sunsets and it's a great chance to meet other travelers. Food was great, I had breakfast here everyday and dinner twice and beers are cheap. You can't beat the views and the music was always perfect. They cut the music around 9pm so it's easy to go to bed early. The hike up the hill to get there isn't easy but it's doable and worth it. I liked that this hostel was up in the hills but didn't require a moto taxi to get to from town. The staff was amazing at this hostel and I even got a massage and facial from Melissa, highly recommend! If you're not into bugs, don't stay here, but if you want an incredible experience in Minca and are looking to meet others I cannot recommend Casa Loma enough.Colleen McCreesh \u2014 Google reviewThe view is spectacular! I would just book a room here to see the amazing sunsets here!\nI didn't stay here, but i did enjoyed some lovely sunsets here.\nThey also have live music here, yoga in the morning and a very good vegetarian menu.\nThe hike upthere is quiet difficult, but soooo worth it!Marije Van Neck \u2014 Google reviewThis is a special place for those active travelers who are looking for a relaxing reprieve from the cities. It's a steep 450 meter (1/4 mile) climb from the road, but you arrive to stunning views of the mountains, Santa Marta, and ocean below. The elevation provides access to a nice breeze and the vibe is a relaxed yoga atmosphere with shared reading spaces and communal areas to mingle with other travelers.\nThe rooms are rustic. You don't come here to hang out in your room. You come here to lounge in the open air spaces and simply sleep in the room. We had a double bed hut. The bug netting was clean and adequate to protect from the bugs. The bed was comfy and clean. The shared toilets are well lit and surprisingly clean.Jesse Sellars \u2014 Google reviewWe really enjoyed our stay at Casa Loma. The food and views were excellent. The hike up wasn\u2019t too tough. Tania helped us so much when we were there as we had to moves rooms a few times due to us booking separate nights. Our stay was excellent, thank you Taniamegan wilson \u2014 Google reviewI booked 2 nights, stayed 10 days. I loved the atmosphere of the place. I would especially like to mention my gratitude to the amazing staff.\n\nUnfortunately I don't remember all the names of the amazing staff, that worked there. The ones I kept in my brain were Jeremias and Ray, who did an outstanding Job at the bar. Always friendly and up for a nice chat.\n\nAlso Guillermo was amazing. After a couple of days he made me feel at home and it felt like a true friendship. Thanks for the moments and conversations galactic brother.\n\nI am very happy to have stayed in casa Loma. Especially nice was the atmosphere with the staff. It did not feel, that they would just work there, it felt that I visit their home. So much passion, customer service and honesty. Please don't change! I will always keep this place and you in my heart.Max B. \u2014 Google reviewThis place is very beautiful, however, I would recommend staying somewhere else and just coming for sunset and drinks as the rooms are not worth the money. The vibe is cool but it was very hard to sleep at night - as you are outside there is a lot of bugs, they blasted music until 4am whilst I was there and then staff were speaking very loudly outside the dorm at 7:30am.\n\nPros:\nVeggie food good and reasonably priced\nDrinks reasonable too\nSetting and sunset is amazing\n\nCons:\nBeds are expensive and very basic\nSteep uphill climb to get to it, which was really horrible with our bags\nRooms are very basic/outdoors which is fine but it\u2019s really loud at night\nAmenities could be improvedFredie Sharp \u2014 Google reviewcalle 1 #No 5, Minca, Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia\u2022https://hotels.cloudbeds.com/reservation/bUfRkK14FOG\u00d3N DEL SOL - Cocina De RaizSaveSlide 1 of 45.0(3)RestaurantVia a Minca #KM 12, Minca, Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia\u2022http://soldeminca.com/15Marhaba restaurant Minca, best food in MincaSaveSlide 1 of 44.8(71)\u20223.0(3)RestaurantFood manufacturerFood producerLebanese restaurantShawarma restaurantVegan restaurantSlide 1 of 3Excellent libanese food!\nIt's affordable and has an amazing quality of the food!\nIt's the best middle East restaurant we had in all Latin America!\nTotally recommended!Antoine Corbillet \u2014 Google reviewAbsolutely delicious Lebanese food in the center of Minca.

We had to wait 90 minutes for our food which was cold when it finally arrived. We ordered 1 beer and after a while we wanted to order another one but no one was coming up to our table. After an hour I got up to ask for another beer at the bar and they acted annoyed. Also, stray dogs and cats were constantly getting in begging for food and some were agressive. I saw some other people being very scared but the staff did not do anything.Tess Bremer \u2014 Google reviewMinca, Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia\u2022http://www.marhabaminca.com/I'll never travel to Minca without this trip planner againStart planningLearn moreI will never travel to Minca without this app againAvailable on the App StoreDownload now16Amora Cocina SaludableSaveSlide 1 of 25.0(43)\u20225.0(1)RestaurantCafeteriaHealth food storeSlide 1 of 3Great cafe with high quality food.

In Minca you can watch birds, enjoy breathtaking views, walk through coffee and cocoa plantations, visit waterfalls and go for hikes. In this travel guide you can read all my tips for things to do in Minca Colombia, including unique places to stay and restaurants.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable Of Contents\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMinca travel guide | 10 tips and things to do in Minca ColombiaGo birdwatchingVisit the waterfalls in MincaGo for hikes in Minca ColombiaVisit coffee and cocoa plantation La CandelariaEnjoy views at Mundo NuevoEnjoy a drink and meal in one of the Minca restaurants and barsTrekkers Glamping \u2013 where to stay in Minca \u00a0What to do around MincaLa Ciudad Perdida trek ColombiaMini travel guide Minca ColombiaHow long do you want to stay in Minca ColombiaHow to reach Minca in ColombiaMore about Colombia \n\n\nMinca travel guide | 10 tips and things to do in Minca Colombia\nGo birdwatching\nMinca is also called the bird paradise of Colombia and if you walk around here you immediately understand why. There is no place in the world where I saw so many hummingbirds and toucans at the same time. One of the best things to do in Minca in Colombia is therefore to go on a birdwatching tour, to understand more about the different species of birds. Moreover you will train your eyes and see so much more than going out by yourself. \u00a0\n\nMost lodges located on the mountains in Minca offer these tours. In case you are staying in Minca town, you can head out with Jungle Joe. Jungle Joe,\u00a0offers daily tours in the morning where you will explore the Minca surroundings. If you don\u2019t feel like taking a tour, promise me to get up early to spot birds yourself. You will not regret it.\nVisit the waterfalls in Minca \nThere are plenty of waterfalls around Minca in Colombia such as Cascada de Marinka, Cascada Escondida and Pozo Azul. All beautiful places but also often very busy because they can be easily reached by car. Pozo Azul is a 20-minute drive from Minca. You can also go hiking for about an hour, but you walk most of the road along a motorway. It is therefore best to take a motortaxi.\n\n\n\n\nCascada de Marinka is one the largest waterfalls and is a 30-minute drive from Minca. Cascada Escondida, one of the hidden waterfalls in Minca is less crowded. But as the name implies, is it sometime difficult to find, as you really need to know where it is (all motortaxis can help you).\nTip: If you want to visit one of these waterfalls in Minca, try to go very early in the morning and avoid weekends and holidays as much as possible. Tip 2: \u00a0On the way to Pozo Azul, you will pass Panaderia del Bosque, a lovely place for coffee, tea and cake.\nGo for hikes in Minca Colombia\nIn Minca Colombia you can go hiking all day long. It is therefore best to choose some places and include them in your trail. Just try to avoid the paved roads and walk the mountain trails instead. You will past tall trees, plants, flowers and beautiful views. Below in this Minca travel guide you will find a few things to do that are easy to reach by foot.\nTip: Are you short on time but do you want to get the maximum out of your stay? It is also possible to rent a motortaxi and have it drop you off at the different places in Minca. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit coffee and cocoa plantation La Candelaria\nLa Candelaria is a coffee and cocoa plantation, where you can go for a tour and get an explanation of the cocoa process: From seed to cup. At the end of the tour you will feel how cacoa works as a facial mask and of course there are different chocolates to taste. It is small but nice. A visit is worthwhile, if only because of the beautiful location. La Candelaria can be reached by foot from Trekker Glamping\u00a0 within 30 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy views at Mundo Nuevo\nFrom La Candelaria you can continue your journey to Mundo Nuevo. A beautiful trail through the tropical rainforest. Mundo Nuevo is again such a stunning place because of the incredible views of the surroundings. You can have a drink or visit the lower community of the Wiwa indigenous people. Just keep in mind that there are only a few houses and the residents will often hide. A visit is therefore to just get an idea of how people live and to find yourself on indigenous territory.\n\n\n\n\nTip: Do you still have energy left? Then you can follow the trail up the mountain to a viewpoint. Here you have a 360-degree view of the surroundings.\nEnjoy a drink and meal in one of the Minca restaurants and bars\nMinca in Colombia is a small village, with a church and a number of shops and restaurants. It is nice to walk around, but especially to have a meal or drink on one of the terraces, located at the river or plaza. My personal favorites are Lazy Cat, Amora and bakery La Miga.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrekkers Glamping \u2013 where to stay in Minca \u00a0\nThere are countless beautiful places to stay in Minca. But where to stay in Minca if you looking for something unique? Then spend the night at Trekker Glamping. Here you will find 5 luxuriously furnished domes, located in a natural environment. From your private terrace, you can enjoy amazing views of the jungle, Santa Marta and the Caribbean coast.\n In the next article I\u2019ll tell you more about my stay at Trekker Glamping.\n\n\n\nThe 5 domes are simple but furnished with nice materials. Each dome has its own terrace with a few chairs and a built-in hammock.\u00a0Trekker Glamping\u00a0has its own restaurant and offers different tours. Moreover it can call itself the owner of one of the most beautiful jacuzzis. \u00a0And there is nothing better than enjoying the sunset, with a cocktail in your hands, after a full day visiting the many things to do in Minca. Trekker Glamping is located halfway up the mountain and is a good startingpoint to start your hikes and discover the different things to do in Minca Colombia.\nInterested in staying at\u00a0Trekker Glamping in Minca? Check the availability and latest rates\u00a0here. Looking for more hotels in Minca? This\u00a0is an overview with hotels in Minca. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do around Minca\nLa Ciudad Perdida trek Colombia\nLooking for some adventure? Then the hike to\u00a0the Lost City in Colombia, could be a trip of a lifetime. This lost city of the Tayrona, is located in the middle of the jungle of the Sierra Nevada. The only way to reach this place, is by foot, through the jungle, for four days. You will be hiking for two full days to reach this mysterious city and afterwards you will have to return the exact same way back.\n\nThe highlight of the\u00a0La Ciudad Perdida tour\u00a0is your visit to the archaeological site. There is not much left, but you will be amazed by the colors, mystery and peacefulness, as you won\u2019t find many visitors here. But not only the destination is worth it, the landscape, lush vegetation and isolated indigenous communities along the way, will make every day of this trip unforgettable. All tours start in Santa Marta but it is also possible to be picked up in Minca. \nDo you also want to hike the Lost City? You can book your tour here. In the next article you can read everything you want to know about the Lost City trek and hike in Colombia, including a packing list + many useful tips.\nMini travel guide Minca Colombia\nHow long do you want to stay in Minca Colombia\nYou can visit Minca easily as a day trip from Santa Marta. But if you have the time, spend at least a few nights in Minca to really enjoy the nature, the nice vibe and the many things to do. I therefore recommend a minimum of 2 nights in Minca, so that you have 1 full day to explore the activities of this travel guide. \n\nTry to avoid weekends and holidays. Minca is also a popular weekend escape for the people living in the nearby cities. Especially the waterfalls in Minca will be very crowded. \u00a0\nHow to reach Minca in Colombia\nMinca in Colombia can be easily visited from Santa Marta. Depending on traffic, you can reach Minca in just 45 minutes. You can book your day tour here or take a taxi. Is your hotel, such as Trekker Glamping, located halfway up the mountain? Then it is recommended to book transportation in advance so that the pick-up is waiting for you.  Are you visiting Minca for the day? Then it is best to move around on foot or by scooter. Many motortaxis offer fixed prices and tours that take you to the different places to visit in Minca.\nCurious about what to do in Santa Marta and surroundings?

It\u2019s highly popular with travelers due to its relaxed atmosphere, beautiful landscapes and excellent hostels. However, many visitors don\u2019t have weeks to enjoy chilling out in the village, so here\u2019s a quick guide on how to make the most of 48 hours in Minca.          View All Trips        Arriving at lunchtime from Santa Marta, the first thing to do is grab a bite to eat in town, and there\u2019s nowhere better to do that than at The Lazy Cat, a great little restaurant just opposite the village church, which overlooks the river and serves the best burgers and burritos in town. Then wander across the bridge towards Cafe Minca for a local coffee. Even if you\u2019re not staying there, the adjacent Hotel Minca is worth a visit to enjoy their amazing hummingbird feeders, which attract an array of the colorful little birds.

The best place in town to stay is the delightful Casa Loma Hostel, which is perched on a hillside above the village and commands amazing views over the distant Caribbean Sea and the gorgeous green mountains. Check in here, order a delicious vegan dinner for the evening, then spend the rest of your first day relaxing, enjoying the view and waiting for the sunset. Casa Loma has the best sunset views in town, and there\u2019s even a great happy hour to make the evening pass even quicker. Get an early night, because there\u2019s a lot to do tomorrow.     Wake up nice and early (it\u2019s much cooler and fresher in the morning), and head down into Minca to grab a mototaxi up into the mountains to La Victoria Coffee Farm. This working coffee farm is one of the oldest in Colombia and offers a fascinating glimpse at the old machinery once used to harvest the magic little beans, which is still in use today! Take the tour at La Victoria in the morning, then stick around for lunch to enjoy one of their delicious sandwiches and an ice cold Happy Toucan Beer, which is also brewed on site. After lunch, walk back towards Minca from the farm along the road towards Pozos Naturales (grab another mototaxi if you\u2019re not the hiking type).                                  CARIBBEAN COLOMBIA         Discover Colombia\u2019s Caribbean coast, from Cartagena to Palomino via jungles, rivers and islands.   View Trip            Coffee drying at La Victoria in Minca | \u00a9 Chris Bell / The Culture Trip                Pozos Naturales is a lovely little swimming hole on the river between La Victoria and Minca, and is the perfect place to enjoy a refreshing dip in the cooling waters of the Sierra Nevada (don\u2019t forget to pack your bathing suit when you leave in the morning). There are many stalls along the road from the Pozos to Minca, where you can sample local chocolate and honey products, and enjoy the mountain views. Always keep an eye out for Toucans as well: they are commonly seen along this road. Grab some dinner in Minca \u2013 you\u2019re forgiven if you choose The Lazy Cat again \u2013 and head back up to Casa Loma: there\u2019s still the happy hour to look forward to!     On your final morning, rise nice and early and meet up with Jungle Joe down in the village \u2013 he offers excellent beginner\u2019s birding tours on the trails around the village and is the perfect man with whom to discover the feathered joys of the Santa Marta Mountains. You can see toucans, parrots, owls, woodpeckers and much more with Joe, and he\u2019s a patient and understandable guide. You\u2019ll be finished by 9:30 am, which gives you a couple more hours to enjoy: hop on a quick mototaxi and head to Marinka Waterfalls to enjoy a last cooling dip in the river, before you head back down the mountains to the sweltering heat of the coast.

Plus, the coffee is richly flavored and delicious.\n\nIf you ever make it to Minca, you MUST try this bread, especially early in the morning fresh from the oven. Amazing.Josephine Johnson \u2014 Google reviewCharming little bakery. They make 3 breads - ciabatta, banquets, and chocolate bun. They offer bread samples for tasting if you\u2019re not sure which to get. They also have a proper espresso/coffee machine. Latte and coffee after a day\u2019s activities? Yes, please. My cafe latte and chocolate bread was 8K COP altogether. Google maps show this place as \u201cCrumb Bakery,\u201d which is a bit confusing because their store sign shows \u201cLa Miga.\u201d Luckily people posted pictures. Plus, you can\u2019t miss the commercial size ovens in the back.Lucy \u2014 Google reviewWe tried the donut con dulce de leche and the bread with chocolate chips. While the latter was really tasty, the former one was slightly dry. However, we appreciated the low sugar content in both of them.Ophelie Chuffart \u2014 Google reviewYou must go here if you visit Minca, and I guarantee you will go back once you do! These gals make a mean loaf of bread. My girlfriend and I were extremely pleased to find REAL bread, while staying in Minca for a couple days. It\u2019s truly hard to find quality bread in most of Latin America. They also sell hummus from a shop across the street that pairs very well with the bread products. Highly recommended!Brian Driscoll \u2014 Google reviewBreads, freshly made you can taste it. Better coffe so far than I've had in the 3 days I've here.

They also sell coffee beans. The place is a super traditional coffee factory.Gabe Kagan \u2014 Google reviewWe arrived with high expectations after reading the reviews. Upon arrival a lady asked in what language we would like to do the tour and told us where to go. There was a group that had already started the tour and so we missed its beginning. That was a bit irritating for us. It wouldnt have been a problem for us to wait a bit for a new group to gather. During our tour we saw 2 further groups start the tour\u2026. We felt disappointed for being told to join the group that had already started and not getting the whole tour experience.\nIdk, if they have changed something, but we only recieved one cup of coffee.Margarita K \u2014 Google reviewVery nice coffee factory with machines still in use which are over a 100 years old. We took an (English) tour and learned the coffee bean process from a to z. And we even got to taste the coffee which was included in the tour. All in all a great experience!\nPs. The road from the main road to the factory is a dirt road with lots of boog holes and trenches. Definitely recommend to either walk, take a motor (taxi) or some kind of 4*4. Not a normal car.Bva Dk \u2014 Google reviewWow, what an experience!  We hiked all the way from Minca up to Finca Victoria (careful, it's a lonnnnng uphill hike) and I was totally pleasantly surprised with this coffee farm.\n\nThe people are super nice, the place is mega sustainable (everything is run off one generator that's powered by a stream), and the coffee is truly perfect.  I'm not a fan of drip coffee, I like espresso, but this was hand's down some of the best coffee I've ever had (which makes sense, they sell the unroasted beans for an egregious amount).\n\nDid the tour and it was highly informative, learned a lot, got to see the different qualities of beans, how they gravity separate, etc etc.  At the end you get a cup of coffee.\n\nThere's also a small restaurant with beer and snacks, and the area is stunningly beautiful, and we even managed to see some monkeys in the distance.  Much of the walk up to the farm is through coffee trees.\n\nJust keep in mind if you walk that there are dirt bikes and trucks sometimes, and it can be quite dusty if it hasn't rained.  If I were to do it again, I would rent a mountain bike.Max Stanton \u2014 Google reviewEveryone said it was a must do when visiting Minca, but it was kind of underwhelming. For 25000/person plus 15000 motor taxi each way I wouldn't say it's a must do at all. The tour was meh.. included two small cups of coffee, which was good, but wouldn't have it on my list of recommendations for someone visiting the area.Zach \u2014 Google reviewSanta Marta, Magdalena, Colombia4Tienda Cafe MincaSaveSlide 1 of 54.2(55)\u20224.5(99)CafeSlide 1 of 3We had good veggie food here, the Italian panino and veggie burger with homemade fries were tasty.\nIt\u2019s a nice caf\u00e9 and it\u2019s reasonably priced.

The customer service is fantastic and the waitstaff are very friendly.

I tried the Nutella with banana + ice cream and was glad. The portion is quite large for a dessert so it's shareable or you could just eat it as a meal like I did. The place appears small from the outside but it could sit quite a few people. The staff was really friendly and they have English or Spanish menu.Lucy \u2014 Google reviewAn absolute gem of a place in Minca. We headed there for the 5pm-7pm happy hour with $10000  burgers and $5000 cups of wine.\n\nThat burger was sitting between a couple of clouds of deliciousness.

I had breakfast and lunch here, and everything was excellent. I love veggies but it\u2019s so hard to find a good filling and delicious salad in Colombia, but Agua de Rio delivered. The AC works too, and the decor is contemporary with a retro vibe. Super comfortable and inviting.

Super tasty, fresh and great presentation. The chef has definitely tried to be creative, and make a food with a twist. We had the wraps and a salad, both outstanding. One of the best food we had on our travel. They deserve more crowd. We highly recommend this place. And this comes from two chefs from London. Well done \ud83d\ude0aElena Smileva \u2014 Google reviewWorst meal of our lives. Horrible service and attitude...wait staff rolling eyes. Asked specifically for patacones and they gave us fried sweet banana, ordered a bacon burger and came with no bacon, asked for no milk or cheese with my mushrooms and they served me raw undercooked mushrooms submerged in cheesy watery soup, the chicken seemed as if they microwaved it. Overcharged for the tiny portion. Addressed the issue and there was no apologies. Got diarrea after. Not sure if the people staffing at the moment were the owners but whoever was there were non-shalant and careless, did not welcome us and despite the basic request from the menu they decided to make whatever they felt like rather than acknowledging what was on the description of our order. Would not recommend this place for anyone.Hanna Casta?eda \u2014 Google reviewWe wanted food to go and the chef came out to talk to us about all the options. We ended up getting chicken and cheese sandwiches with mushrooms cooked in wine-so tasty!

It\u2019s a small town with plenty to do!Scroll down to see a map of all mentioned places.EatDuni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuni is a cafe serving a full breakfast and lunch menu, as well as homemade breads and ice cream, in a beautiful space. Get here early for your pick of their homemade breads, and definitely enjoy a meal if you have time. Everything was fresh, delicious, and thoughtfully presented. If you\u2019re feeling decadent, go for their chocolate bread french toast. The staff is lean and service can be a little slow, so it\u2019s definitely a place to sit and relax. La Miga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother cafe with delicious breads and coffees. The chocolate bread at La Miga, which is very different from Duni\u2019s version, was so good. We saw some people ordering sandwiches, but breads and coffee seem to be their main thing. When we were there, they were offering generous samples at the counter. On Google Maps this is called \u201cCrumb Bakery.\u201dSailor Will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSailor Will was on our way to our hostel, so we stopped in for lunch right after we got off the colectivo from Santa Marta. The space was beautiful, the staff was really friendly, and we could see the small kitchen from our table. We shared the menu del dia, which was a big portion of rice, meat, plantains, avocado, and beans. We didn't get pictures of the food, but obviously plenty of pictures of the Club Colombias we washed our meal down with.El Bistro de la Victoria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEl Bistro de la Victoria is the restaurant attached to Finca Victoria (more on that below). After a very steep hike up to the coffee farm, we were so happy to sit down at the Bistro with a couple of cold beers and sandwiches before our coffee tour. The sandwiches were huge and we probably could have shared one. Nevada Cerveceria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beers we drank at El Bistro de la Victoria are from Nevada Cerveceria, the brewery right next door to the coffee farm. You can only find their beers in a few places in this region, so I recommend trying them if you come across them. We had the pilsner and really liked it, and if you\u2019re judging a book by its cover, the labels are pretty cool. Casa Loma\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nCasa Loma, the hostel we stayed at served homemade vegetarian breakfast, lunch, and dinner at reasonable prices. We ate dinner there both nights of our stay, and some people who weren\u2019t even staying at the hostel came for the meal (it\u2019s about a 10-minute hike uphill from town, which should say something!). Each night there\u2019s one appetizer, entree, and dessert on the menu, which is posted on a chalkboard that morning so you can decide if you want to sign up. The food is individually plated and served at the shared tables where you can get to know your fellow travelers. Both our dinners were delicious with generous portions and high-quality ingredients. Lazy CatWe didn\u2019t get to try Lazy Cat, right across from Sailor Inn, but we heard from multiple people that while eating on the outdoor deck, a Toucan stopped by, ate some fries, and flew away. Sounds worth it just for that!DoSunset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sunsets in Minca are beautiful. Get up to any high point and watch the sun go down and the sky change colors in between the mountains. We watched the sunset from the sunset deck at our hostel both nights. Like the dinners, many people come up to Casa Loma just for that. Pozo Azul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s about a 45-minute hike up the road from town before a 15-minute walk down the path to Pozo Azul, a swimming hole. The first swimming hole was packed. We crossed this area (you have to walk through the water, so we had to take our socks and sneakers off and then put them back on) and hiked up to the second swimming hole, which was less crowded and a bit deeper. We watched teenage boys jump off the high cliff before we jumped off a slightly lower cliff :). We hiked just a little bit farther up to another swimming hole that was virtually empty, where we sat and read for a bit. There are no amenities here, save for a couple ladies grilling plantains at the entrance, so come prepared. Finca Victoria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe debated hiking up to Finca Victoria from Pozo Azul or taking a moto-taxi but ultimately walked up and took a moto-taxi back down. This hike up is very steep and challenging, but with beautiful views. We speed-walked (as much as we could uphill) and it took us 50 minutes from the start of the path to Pozo Azul. We started with lunch at the restaurant attached to the farm (see above) before our tour. There\u2019s no tour schedule, they just take you around whenever you\u2019re ready, maybe waiting to see if a couple more people show up. The tour costs $15,000 pesos and includes a cup of their coffee. La Victoria has been around since 1892 and uses water and gravity to power their automatic production of coffee beans. It\u2019s pretty impressive and we learned a lot from our knowledgeable tour guide.Chill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially if you\u2019re coming to Minca from a big city, this is a good time to relax. Life seems pretty laid-back here, and our hostel was a great place to catch up on reading, play cards, and take in the views while surrounded by nature.Moto-taxiAs mentioned, we took a moto-taxi back to our hostel from Finca Victoria. Look for the guys in black polos with blue writing; these are the official Minca moto-taxi drivers. It\u2019s a fun experience, just hold on tight!  We were only in Minca for two nights so didn\u2019t get to do everything. Here are a few other activities we read about on the blog Practical Wanderlust: Las PiedrasLas Cascadas de MarinkaFinca La CandelariaShoppingStayCasa Loma Minca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were really happy with our decision to stay at Casa Loma. As I mentioned a couple times above, people who aren\u2019t even sleeping there come up for meals and the sunset because they have so much to offer. They have a number of different types of accommodations including private rooms, open-air huts, dorms, hammocks, and tents. We chose the Casa Luna hut for its views and its private bathroom (the only one offered). This hut is secluded from the rest of the camp and has a wide open view of the mountains, plus the night sky full of stars - something you don\u2019t get in New York City! The shower has the same view, which was pretty amazing. The hut has a mosquito net over the bed and a big wooden locker, which we put all our stuff in when not using, including toiletries, for security and to keep animals away. The hut has a curtain in lieu of a door, and the noises we heard in the night took some getting used to, but waking up and going to bed with that view was worth it. Even though we stayed in the secluded hut with our own bathroom, we took advantage of the benefits of staying in a hostel, such as group dinners and meeting other travelers. We enjoyed sitting in the hammocks and at the picnic tables in the main lodge playing cards and reading. If you can manage the hike up to Casa Loma from town, I recommend booking a room here!EAT AND DO IN MINCA - MAP VIEW\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nALL COLOMBIA BLOG POSTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2019\n\n\n\nColombia, Minca, Minca activities, To Do\n\n\n\nVisiting Minca, Colombia\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2019\n\n\n\nColombia, Minca, Minca activities, To Do\n\n\nOn my recent trip to Colombia with my sister, we spent a couple nights in Minca, which is in the mountains a few hours north of Cartagena.

The burger fell apart a bit, though taste wise it was fine.\n\nThe margaritas were outstanding as was rhe barmaid that glanced for approval.\nThe mojitos are average - I'd recommend going to KHITAJO GASTROBAR for a fab mojito + their mincacao is divine.\n\nNice background music.Carl Mendes \u2014 Google reviewFantastic menu with lots of different tastes - THAT ALL WERE GREAT.

It is to be noted that I was given a choice from three bottles of various red wine - on three price levels each being 10000 COP in difference\u2026 which I think to be superb giving the diner a choice in that circumstance.

Dishes were very good size, and a medium pizza is enough for two people while a large is good for 3. The pasta were flavorful, and large but sauce tasted a bit watery. Serv\u00ed e was quick and attentive, and we had the whole upper floor to ourselves. Not the cheapest option in town. Oh also, the chicken fajita on the menu is just a burrito, so don't expect anything different. Overall, really good dinner.samuel dean \u2014 Google reviewVery surprised as my partner is Italian and have high standards I guess - super tasty pastas!

Well done \ud83d\ude0aElena Smileva \u2014 Google reviewWorst meal of our lives. Horrible service and attitude...wait staff rolling eyes. Asked specifically for patacones and they gave us fried sweet banana, ordered a bacon burger and came with no bacon, asked for no milk or cheese with my mushrooms and they served me raw undercooked mushrooms submerged in cheesy watery soup, the chicken seemed as if they microwaved it. Overcharged for the tiny portion. Addressed the issue and there was no apologies. Got diarrea after. Not sure if the people staffing at the moment were the owners but whoever was there were non-shalant and careless, did not welcome us and despite the basic request from the menu they decided to make whatever they felt like rather than acknowledging what was on the description of our order. Would not recommend this place for anyone.Hanna Casta?eda \u2014 Google reviewWe wanted food to go and the chef came out to talk to us about all the options.

The owner Stefan was so sound and we had great chats.\n\nThe atomsphere of the place seems very open minded and free. All the food in the restaurant is vegetarian and loads of vegan options. The food was amazing.\n\nYou must climb a relatively steep hill to get up there so please be aware of this, but it means that you get the best views of the sunset.\n\nTheres also yoga studio and spa treatments which i should have availed of.\n\nLastly, theres kittens there at the moment and they are ADORABLE.\n\nAll of these factors made it probably my favourite hostel ive stayed in!!! Thanks for the stay \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9aConnie Colgan \u2014 Google reviewLOVED my stay here, did not want to leave. I booked Casa Luna for 3 nights, which is in the far back with it's own private shower and bathroom, so my experience with the room may be different than those who stayed in dorms/hammocks but I found the room very comfortable and clean. I had plenty of space and the outdoor bathroom was super clean, as were the communal bathrooms by reception. The vibe here is amazing, everyones gathers on the deck for sunsets and it's a great chance to meet other travelers. Food was great, I had breakfast here everyday and dinner twice and beers are cheap. You can't beat the views and the music was always perfect. They cut the music around 9pm so it's easy to go to bed early. The hike up the hill to get there isn't easy but it's doable and worth it. I liked that this hostel was up in the hills but didn't require a moto taxi to get to from town. The staff was amazing at this hostel and I even got a massage and facial from Melissa, highly recommend! If you're not into bugs, don't stay here, but if you want an incredible experience in Minca and are looking to meet others I cannot recommend Casa Loma enough.Colleen McCreesh \u2014 Google reviewThe view is spectacular! I would just book a room here to see the amazing sunsets here!\nI didn't stay here, but i did enjoyed some lovely sunsets here.\nThey also have live music here, yoga in the morning and a very good vegetarian menu.\nThe hike upthere is quiet difficult, but soooo worth it!Marije Van Neck \u2014 Google reviewThis is a special place for those active travelers who are looking for a relaxing reprieve from the cities. It's a steep 450 meter (1/4 mile) climb from the road, but you arrive to stunning views of the mountains, Santa Marta, and ocean below. The elevation provides access to a nice breeze and the vibe is a relaxed yoga atmosphere with shared reading spaces and communal areas to mingle with other travelers.\nThe rooms are rustic. You don't come here to hang out in your room. You come here to lounge in the open air spaces and simply sleep in the room. We had a double bed hut. The bug netting was clean and adequate to protect from the bugs. The bed was comfy and clean. The shared toilets are well lit and surprisingly clean.Jesse Sellars \u2014 Google reviewWe really enjoyed our stay at Casa Loma. The food and views were excellent. The hike up wasn\u2019t too tough.

I would especially like to mention my gratitude to the amazing staff.\n\nUnfortunately I don't remember all the names of the amazing staff, that worked there. The ones I kept in my brain were Jeremias and Ray, who did an outstanding Job at the bar. Always friendly and up for a nice chat.\n\nAlso Guillermo was amazing. After a couple of days he made me feel at home and it felt like a true friendship. Thanks for the moments and conversations galactic brother.\n\nI am very happy to have stayed in casa Loma. Especially nice was the atmosphere with the staff. It did not feel, that they would just work there, it felt that I visit their home. So much passion, customer service and honesty. Please don't change! I will always keep this place and you in my heart.Max B. \u2014 Google reviewThis place is very beautiful, however, I would recommend staying somewhere else and just coming for sunset and drinks as the rooms are not worth the money. The vibe is cool but it was very hard to sleep at night - as you are outside there is a lot of bugs, they blasted music until 4am whilst I was there and then staff were speaking very loudly outside the dorm at 7:30am.\n\nPros:\nVeggie food good and reasonably priced\nDrinks reasonable too\nSetting and sunset is amazing\n\nCons:\nBeds are expensive and very basic\nSteep uphill climb to get to it, which was really horrible with our bags\nRooms are very basic/outdoors which is fine but it\u2019s really loud at night\nAmenities could be improvedFredie Sharp \u2014 Google reviewcalle 1 #No 5, Minca, Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia\u2022https://hotels.cloudbeds.com/reservation/bUfRkK15RESTAURANTE ASADERO CAMARITASaveSlide 1 of 44.4(100)\u20224.5(8)RestaurantSlide 1 of 3Magical experience and best food in Minca.Tom Tenney \u2014 Google reviewI was probably the only foreigner in this restaurant.

My plate did not have potatoes like offered in the menu, the waiter said they are out of stock. After complaining they brought me potatoes within 2 minutes. I paid more than offered in the menu.

We had to wait 90 minutes for our food which was cold when it finally arrived. We ordered 1 beer and after a while we wanted to order another one but no one was coming up to our table. After an hour I got up to ask for another beer at the bar and they acted annoyed. Also, stray dogs and cats were constantly getting in begging for food and some were agressive. I saw some other people being very scared but the staff did not do anything.Tess Bremer \u2014 Google reviewMinca, Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia\u2022http://www.marhabaminca.com/19saranagati cafe bistroSaveSlide 1 of 45.0(1)\u20225.0(2)Vegetarian cafe and deliSlide 1 of 1(Translated by Google) Excellent vegan and vegetarian food!

New kinds of ramen seem to be popping up in the city each week, made with everything from brisket and Wagyu beef to bone marrow and black garlic oil. Save those instant noodles in your pantry for the next time you forget to buy groceries, and head to one of these places for an exceptional bowl of soup that you couldn't make yourself.THE SPOTSOkiboru House of TsukemenIf you see a line of people on the sidewalk around Orchard and Delancey, it\u2019s probably for Okiboru. Even if you\u2019re not in the mood for noodles, go ahead and join. At this LES ramen shop, the namesake tsukemen comes with udon-like cold noodles you dip in a warm, concentrated broth that tastes like it\u2019s made with a million bonito flakes. The soupy ramen, which is just as good, is made with a super rich, milky broth that'll immediately conjure images of pork bones in your head. We overheard someone ask their friend: \u201cHow was it?\u201d Response: \u201cIt was bomb.\u201d We agree.Kohoku-Ku RamenKohoku-Ku ramen is a tiny restaurant in Hell's Kitchen filled with colorful paper lanterns, makeshift seating made from repurposed Suntory crates, and a very fun bathroom. If you like your ramen broth incredibly thick and rich, you'll love the soup here, which borders on gravy. The Kumamoto, made with an ultra-concentrated pork and black garlic broth, is our go-to order here, but the spicy miso and grilled mackerel options are great, too. The menu also covers all the classic izakaya dishes, like yakitori, curry rice and karaage. It's pretty close to Times Square, but is far enough away from the main action that you can use this as a non-touristy pre-theater option. Marufuku RamenThe East Coast outpost of this popular San Francisco ramen shop is one of the better options for a quick bowl of noodles in the East Village. Tonkotsu ramen is their speciality, and the pork broth here is some of the richest, creamiest we\u2019ve had. The Hakata Tonkotsu DX version comes with not one but two kinds of pork belly, both meltingly tender and deeply spiced, as well as corn, nori, and a very perfect soft-boiled seasoned egg. The noodles are of the thin variety, and they have a pleasantly chewy texture.NRNR\u2019s ramen ranges from simple Kyoto and Sapporo-style bowls to more unique options like a soupless ramen made with Wagyu beef and bone marrow. And while you might raise an eyebrow at a bowl of noodles that sounds like stunt food, you don\u2019t have to worry about that here. Everything on the menu at this UES spot is great. Just go with what your heart wants.Shinka Ramen & Sake BarTucked away inside the Wyndham Garden Chinatown hotel, this place isn\u2019t the easiest to find, but that\u2019s good (for you) because it keeps the crowds away. Stop by for a bowl of Shinka\u2019s bone marrow ramen with murky, beefy broth. It comes with well-marbled slices of brisket, tons of garlic chips, discs of daikon, and a big bone sawed in half so you can scoop out all the marrow to make the broth even richer.Ramen IshidaYou\u2019ll have to sit quite literally shoulder to shoulder to eat at this teeny tiny LES ramen spot, but their shoyu and miso ramen are totally worth it. The thick, chewy noodles wrap around each slab of fatty pork like an octopus gripping onto its prey, and the broth is flavorful enough to function as full-on aromatherapy. Despite there being only eight seats in the cramped space, you rarely end up waiting more than 10 minutes to sit, and no one will rush you. Take your time and order some appetizers, too. We sometimes stop by just for pork buns and karaage. Karazishi BotanYou\u2019ll find some of the more inventive bowls of ramen in New York at Karazishi Botan, which was opened by the former ramen master at Ippudo. The signature Pan Head, made with a pork and miso broth and straightforward toppings like chashu and bamboo, is assertively salty in the best way. Other options change often, but we recently had a chicken-based ramen that came with a scoop of mashed potatoes and a shot glass of lemon juice on the side. It was a wild ride.\u00a0E.A.K RamenIf you\u2019re looking for a relatively rare bowl of ramen, head to E.A.K. in the West Village. Their iekei-style ramen comes with a broth made from chicken and pork bones (in addition to shoyu tare), with thick, spaghetti-like noodles and spinach instead of scallions. The result is a salty, milky, and rich broth that looks like cream of chicken soup. We have no complaints about the namesake E.A.K. Shoyu bowl\u2014except that the chashu is among the best we\u2019ve had, and only two small slices are included. Get extra.MincaMinca\u2019s cramped dining room is situated around an open kitchen, hot steam constantly flowing through the space. It\u2019s perfect for a soothing solo meal or casual date night when you don't want it to seem like you\u2019re trying too hard. We love that you can get a bowl made with half pork and half chicken broth, and the tsukemen here is particularly great. The daikon salad, a mountain of shredded radish drenched in sesame sauce, is one of our favorite ways to eat that particular vegetable. IppudoThe rich, porky ramen at Ippudo is still one of the best bowls of noodle soup one can eat in New York City. The original East Village location has absurdly long waits much of the time, so consider making a solo pilgrimage, or just tell your boss you have to leave work at 4pm for a doctor\u2019s appointment. Their pork buns are a must-order as well.Ivan RamenWill Ivan Ramen\u2019s Spicy Red Chili Ramen burn a hole in your esophagus? Don\u2019t worry about that now. For the time being, just eat your way through this very hot ramen until tears drip down your face. They do have non-spicy options too, and the lively Lower East Side space is a fun place for a small group dinner.Totto RamenAt this Midtown spot, the broth is made from chicken rather than pork. The soup still comes topped with pieces of pork though, so this isn\u2019t exactly a light meal. It is a very, very good one though, and everyone in the Midtown area knows it. Expect to wait, or come solo.IchiranIchiran is Japanese chain with a location in Bushwick where you can eat your ramen in a \u201cflavor concentration booth.\u201d Think of it as a study carrel in a college library, but for solo ramen eating. Ordering here is done by filling out a form and pressing a button, so human interaction is minimal. If you\u2019re afraid of loneliness, you can eat in an actual dining room (or just lower the partition between booths). The highly customizable ramen is solid, and the overall experience makes this place worth visiting at least once.Suggested ReadingGuideOur Favorite Casual Neighborhood Sushi Spots In NYCSearching for that elusive middle ground of reasonable, casual neighborhood sushi?

Super tasty, fresh and great presentation. The chef has definitely tried to be creative, and make a food with a twist. We had the wraps and a salad, both outstanding. One of the best food we had on our travel. They deserve more crowd. We highly recommend this place. And this comes from two chefs from London. Well done \ud83d\ude0aElena Smileva \u2014 Google reviewWorst meal of our lives. Horrible service and attitude...wait staff rolling eyes. Asked specifically for patacones and they gave us fried sweet banana, ordered a bacon burger and came with no bacon, asked for no milk or cheese with my mushrooms and they served me raw undercooked mushrooms submerged in cheesy watery soup, the chicken seemed as if they microwaved it. Overcharged for the tiny portion. Addressed the issue and there was no apologies. Got diarrea after. Not sure if the people staffing at the moment were the owners but whoever was there were non-shalant and careless, did not welcome us and despite the basic request from the menu they decided to make whatever they felt like rather than acknowledging what was on the description of our order. Would not recommend this place for anyone.Hanna Casta?eda \u2014 Google reviewWe wanted food to go and the chef came out to talk to us about all the options. We ended up getting chicken and cheese sandwiches with mushrooms cooked in wine-so tasty! And the fries had parmesan and other seasonings, they were delicious as well.Dana Bustamante \u2014 Google reviewFinca Federico, Minca, Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia\u2022https://laycafe.negocio.site/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=referral10Wakati Healthy grillSave5.0(20)RestaurantCra. 5\u00aa #261, Minca, Santa Marta, Magdalena, ColombiaI'll never travel to Minca without this trip planner againStart planningLearn moreI will never travel to Minca without this app againAvailable on the App StoreDownload now11RESTAURANTE TAGUA BARSaveSlide 1 of 44.1(123)\u20223.0(16)RestaurantSlide 1 of 3The name was changed, but the food is amazing, the staff is helpfulHeged?s Ivett \u2014 Google reviewGood option to eat in Minca. Typical Colombian dishes which are well prepared for a fair price ; many of the other places are either wanna-be fancy or just have international kitchen. The terrace is also quite nice and you can observe street life whilst eating. I ate there twice during my stay and I was happy. Thanks :)Daniel Felix Volkmann \u2014 Google reviewThe food took long to get service. The fish was small, the vegetarian sandwich was so so. And the patacones we ordered as was not serving when we were going to finish dinner, we asked to cancel the service and the waiter said he forgot to tell us there were no more.Laura Cardona \u2014 Google reviewVia a Minca, Santa Marta, Minca, Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia12Restaurante Do\u00f1a AnaSaveSlide 1 of 34.1(612)\u20224.5(16)$$$$cheapRestaurantThe restaurant is cozy, with good food and big servings.

Very helpful and friendly. I eat and hung out a bit.  I like meat and steaks but this was truly excellent!   Great vibe and view.  Many seem to be camping here.  It is a climb to get here but part of the experience if you didn't overpack and fit.James L \u2014 Google reviewI just wish I could have stayed longer here. Its a very beautiful hostel, the views of Minca and Santa Marta are incredible. It seemed to be doing great business as we wanted to extrnd our stay but it was booked out! The staff are amazing, I only got one of their names Tanya who was the front desk was really nice and helpful. The owner Stefan was so sound and we had great chats.\n\nThe atomsphere of the place seems very open minded and free. All the food in the restaurant is vegetarian and loads of vegan options. The food was amazing.\n\nYou must climb a relatively steep hill to get up there so please be aware of this, but it means that you get the best views of the sunset.\n\nTheres also yoga studio and spa treatments which i should have availed of.\n\nLastly, theres kittens there at the moment and they are ADORABLE.\n\nAll of these factors made it probably my favourite hostel ive stayed in!!! Thanks for the stay \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9aConnie Colgan \u2014 Google reviewLOVED my stay here, did not want to leave. I booked Casa Luna for 3 nights, which is in the far back with it's own private shower and bathroom, so my experience with the room may be different than those who stayed in dorms/hammocks but I found the room very comfortable and clean. I had plenty of space and the outdoor bathroom was super clean, as were the communal bathrooms by reception. The vibe here is amazing, everyones gathers on the deck for sunsets and it's a great chance to meet other travelers. Food was great, I had breakfast here everyday and dinner twice and beers are cheap. You can't beat the views and the music was always perfect. They cut the music around 9pm so it's easy to go to bed early. The hike up the hill to get there isn't easy but it's doable and worth it. I liked that this hostel was up in the hills but didn't require a moto taxi to get to from town. The staff was amazing at this hostel and I even got a massage and facial from Melissa, highly recommend! If you're not into bugs, don't stay here, but if you want an incredible experience in Minca and are looking to meet others I cannot recommend Casa Loma enough.Colleen McCreesh \u2014 Google reviewThe view is spectacular! I would just book a room here to see the amazing sunsets here!\nI didn't stay here, but i did enjoyed some lovely sunsets here.\nThey also have live music here, yoga in the morning and a very good vegetarian menu.\nThe hike upthere is quiet difficult, but soooo worth it!Marije Van Neck \u2014 Google reviewThis is a special place for those active travelers who are looking for a relaxing reprieve from the cities. It's a steep 450 meter (1/4 mile) climb from the road, but you arrive to stunning views of the mountains, Santa Marta, and ocean below. The elevation provides access to a nice breeze and the vibe is a relaxed yoga atmosphere with shared reading spaces and communal areas to mingle with other travelers.\nThe rooms are rustic. You don't come here to hang out in your room. You come here to lounge in the open air spaces and simply sleep in the room. We had a double bed hut. The bug netting was clean and adequate to protect from the bugs. The bed was comfy and clean. The shared toilets are well lit and surprisingly clean.Jesse Sellars \u2014 Google reviewWe really enjoyed our stay at Casa Loma. The food and views were excellent. The hike up wasn\u2019t too tough. Tania helped us so much when we were there as we had to moves rooms a few times due to us booking separate nights. Our stay was excellent, thank you Taniamegan wilson \u2014 Google reviewI booked 2 nights, stayed 10 days. I loved the atmosphere of the place. I would especially like to mention my gratitude to the amazing staff.\n\nUnfortunately I don't remember all the names of the amazing staff, that worked there. The ones I kept in my brain were Jeremias and Ray, who did an outstanding Job at the bar. Always friendly and up for a nice chat.\n\nAlso Guillermo was amazing. After a couple of days he made me feel at home and it felt like a true friendship. Thanks for the moments and conversations galactic brother.\n\nI am very happy to have stayed in casa Loma. Especially nice was the atmosphere with the staff. It did not feel, that they would just work there, it felt that I visit their home. So much passion, customer service and honesty. Please don't change! I will always keep this place and you in my heart.Max B. \u2014 Google reviewThis place is very beautiful, however, I would recommend staying somewhere else and just coming for sunset and drinks as the rooms are not worth the money. The vibe is cool but it was very hard to sleep at night - as you are outside there is a lot of bugs, they blasted music until 4am whilst I was there and then staff were speaking very loudly outside the dorm at 7:30am.\n\nPros:\nVeggie food good and reasonably priced\nDrinks reasonable too\nSetting and sunset is amazing\n\nCons:\nBeds are expensive and very basic\nSteep uphill climb to get to it, which was really horrible with our bags\nRooms are very basic/outdoors which is fine but it\u2019s really loud at night\nAmenities could be improvedFredie Sharp \u2014 Google reviewcalle 1 #No 5, Minca, Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia\u2022https://hotels.cloudbeds.com/reservation/bUfRkK15RESTAURANTE ASADERO CAMARITASaveSlide 1 of 44.4(100)\u20224.5(8)RestaurantSlide 1 of 3Magical experience and best food in Minca.Tom Tenney \u2014 Google reviewI was probably the only foreigner in this restaurant. Ive been waiting 1,5 hours for my lunch, Pork Rips. Many colombians who arrived after me, got their food before me. My plate did not have potatoes like offered in the menu, the waiter said they are out of stock. After complaining they brought me potatoes within 2 minutes. I paid more than offered in the menu. Maybe prices in the menu are not up-to-date. The pork ribs were only fat, no real meat. I did not order pork belly. The only thing which was good, was the view.Lukas \u2014 Google reviewUnique!

We had to wait 90 minutes for our food which was cold when it finally arrived. We ordered 1 beer and after a while we wanted to order another one but no one was coming up to our table. After an hour I got up to ask for another beer at the bar and they acted annoyed. Also, stray dogs and cats were constantly getting in begging for food and some were agressive.

It really is delicious.

Plus, the coffee is richly flavored and delicious.\n\nIf you ever make it to Minca, you MUST try this bread, especially early in the morning fresh from the oven. Amazing.Josephine Johnson \u2014 Google reviewCharming little bakery. They make 3 breads - ciabatta, banquets, and chocolate bun. They offer bread samples for tasting if you\u2019re not sure which to get. They also have a proper espresso/coffee machine. Latte and coffee after a day\u2019s activities? Yes, please. My cafe latte and chocolate bread was 8K COP altogether. Google maps show this place as \u201cCrumb Bakery,\u201d which is a bit confusing because their store sign shows \u201cLa Miga.\u201d Luckily people posted pictures. Plus, you can\u2019t miss the commercial size ovens in the back.Lucy \u2014 Google reviewWe tried the donut con dulce de leche and the bread with chocolate chips. While the latter was really tasty, the former one was slightly dry. However, we appreciated the low sugar content in both of them.Ophelie Chuffart \u2014 Google reviewYou must go here if you visit Minca, and I guarantee you will go back once you do! These gals make a mean loaf of bread. My girlfriend and I were extremely pleased to find REAL bread, while staying in Minca for a couple days. It\u2019s truly hard to find quality bread in most of Latin America. They also sell hummus from a shop across the street that pairs very well with the bread products. Highly recommended!Brian Driscoll \u2014 Google reviewBreads, freshly made you can taste it. Better coffe so far than I've had in the 3 days I've here.

And they also have the most delicious chai latte!! The atmosphere also is so peaceful as it is in Minca!Jo Sensi \u2014 Google reviewDuni Cafe is a nice place to share a meal (alone works too !!). They have great drinks, I had their Duni drink with Ginger, which was awesome, and a Smoothie. They have different alternatives for vegetarians and vegans, offer a lot of different drinks and plates.\nThe pastries are also awesome, I tried the brownie and the chocolate cake, both awesome.Julien Mathieu \u2014 Google reviewGreat place with good services and healthy food options.

They also sell coffee beans. The place is a super traditional coffee factory.Gabe Kagan \u2014 Google reviewWe arrived with high expectations after reading the reviews. Upon arrival a lady asked in what language we would like to do the tour and told us where to go. There was a group that had already started the tour and so we missed its beginning. That was a bit irritating for us. It wouldnt have been a problem for us to wait a bit for a new group to gather. During our tour we saw 2 further groups start the tour\u2026. We felt disappointed for being told to join the group that had already started and not getting the whole tour experience.\nIdk, if they have changed something, but we only recieved one cup of coffee.Margarita K \u2014 Google reviewVery nice coffee factory with machines still in use which are over a 100 years old. We took an (English) tour and learned the coffee bean process from a to z. And we even got to taste the coffee which was included in the tour. All in all a great experience!\nPs. The road from the main road to the factory is a dirt road with lots of boog holes and trenches. Definitely recommend to either walk, take a motor (taxi) or some kind of 4*4. Not a normal car.Bva Dk \u2014 Google reviewWow, what an experience!  We hiked all the way from Minca up to Finca Victoria (careful, it's a lonnnnng uphill hike) and I was totally pleasantly surprised with this coffee farm.\n\nThe people are super nice, the place is mega sustainable (everything is run off one generator that's powered by a stream), and the coffee is truly perfect.  I'm not a fan of drip coffee, I like espresso, but this was hand's down some of the best coffee I've ever had (which makes sense, they sell the unroasted beans for an egregious amount).\n\nDid the tour and it was highly informative, learned a lot, got to see the different qualities of beans, how they gravity separate, etc etc.  At the end you get a cup of coffee.\n\nThere's also a small restaurant with beer and snacks, and the area is stunningly beautiful, and we even managed to see some monkeys in the distance.  Much of the walk up to the farm is through coffee trees.\n\nJust keep in mind if you walk that there are dirt bikes and trucks sometimes, and it can be quite dusty if it hasn't rained.  If I were to do it again, I would rent a mountain bike.Max Stanton \u2014 Google reviewEveryone said it was a must do when visiting Minca, but it was kind of underwhelming. For 25000/person plus 15000 motor taxi each way I wouldn't say it's a must do at all. The tour was meh.. included two small cups of coffee, which was good, but wouldn't have it on my list of recommendations for someone visiting the area.Zach \u2014 Google reviewSanta Marta, Magdalena, Colombia4Tienda Cafe MincaSaveSlide 1 of 54.2(55)\u20224.5(99)CafeSlide 1 of 3We had good veggie food here, the Italian panino and veggie burger with homemade fries were tasty.\nIt\u2019s a nice caf\u00e9 and it\u2019s reasonably priced.

I tried the Nutella with banana + ice cream and was glad. The portion is quite large for a dessert so it's shareable or you could just eat it as a meal like I did.

The staff was really friendly and they have English or Spanish menu.Lucy \u2014 Google reviewAn absolute gem of a place in Minca. We headed there for the 5pm-7pm happy hour with $10000  burgers and $5000 cups of wine.\n\nThat burger was sitting between a couple of clouds of deliciousness. Never have I had such a fresh burger bun before. It was served with a handful of freshly cut chips and the wine was absolutely perfect.\n\nCustomer service was top notch and we had a great night.

One of the best food we had on our travel. They deserve more crowd. We highly recommend this place. And this comes from two chefs from London. Well done \ud83d\ude0aElena Smileva \u2014 Google reviewWorst meal of our lives. Horrible service and attitude...wait staff rolling eyes. Asked specifically for patacones and they gave us fried sweet banana, ordered a bacon burger and came with no bacon, asked for no milk or cheese with my mushrooms and they served me raw undercooked mushrooms submerged in cheesy watery soup, the chicken seemed as if they microwaved it. Overcharged for the tiny portion. Addressed the issue and there was no apologies. Got diarrea after. Not sure if the people staffing at the moment were the owners but whoever was there were non-shalant and careless, did not welcome us and despite the basic request from the menu they decided to make whatever they felt like rather than acknowledging what was on the description of our order. Would not recommend this place for anyone.Hanna Casta?eda \u2014 Google reviewWe wanted food to go and the chef came out to talk to us about all the options. We ended up getting chicken and cheese sandwiches with mushrooms cooked in wine-so tasty!

It\u2019s a small town with plenty to do!Scroll down to see a map of all mentioned places.EatDuni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuni is a cafe serving a full breakfast and lunch menu, as well as homemade breads and ice cream, in a beautiful space. Get here early for your pick of their homemade breads, and definitely enjoy a meal if you have time. Everything was fresh, delicious, and thoughtfully presented. If you\u2019re feeling decadent, go for their chocolate bread french toast. The staff is lean and service can be a little slow, so it\u2019s definitely a place to sit and relax. La Miga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother cafe with delicious breads and coffees. The chocolate bread at La Miga, which is very different from Duni\u2019s version, was so good. We saw some people ordering sandwiches, but breads and coffee seem to be their main thing. When we were there, they were offering generous samples at the counter. On Google Maps this is called \u201cCrumb Bakery.\u201dSailor Will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSailor Will was on our way to our hostel, so we stopped in for lunch right after we got off the colectivo from Santa Marta. The space was beautiful, the staff was really friendly, and we could see the small kitchen from our table. We shared the menu del dia, which was a big portion of rice, meat, plantains, avocado, and beans. We didn't get pictures of the food, but obviously plenty of pictures of the Club Colombias we washed our meal down with.El Bistro de la Victoria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEl Bistro de la Victoria is the restaurant attached to Finca Victoria (more on that below). After a very steep hike up to the coffee farm, we were so happy to sit down at the Bistro with a couple of cold beers and sandwiches before our coffee tour. The sandwiches were huge and we probably could have shared one. Nevada Cerveceria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beers we drank at El Bistro de la Victoria are from Nevada Cerveceria, the brewery right next door to the coffee farm. You can only find their beers in a few places in this region, so I recommend trying them if you come across them. We had the pilsner and really liked it, and if you\u2019re judging a book by its cover, the labels are pretty cool. Casa Loma\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nCasa Loma, the hostel we stayed at served homemade vegetarian breakfast, lunch, and dinner at reasonable prices. We ate dinner there both nights of our stay, and some people who weren\u2019t even staying at the hostel came for the meal (it\u2019s about a 10-minute hike uphill from town, which should say something!). Each night there\u2019s one appetizer, entree, and dessert on the menu, which is posted on a chalkboard that morning so you can decide if you want to sign up. The food is individually plated and served at the shared tables where you can get to know your fellow travelers. Both our dinners were delicious with generous portions and high-quality ingredients. Lazy CatWe didn\u2019t get to try Lazy Cat, right across from Sailor Inn, but we heard from multiple people that while eating on the outdoor deck, a Toucan stopped by, ate some fries, and flew away. Sounds worth it just for that!DoSunset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sunsets in Minca are beautiful. Get up to any high point and watch the sun go down and the sky change colors in between the mountains. We watched the sunset from the sunset deck at our hostel both nights. Like the dinners, many people come up to Casa Loma just for that. Pozo Azul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s about a 45-minute hike up the road from town before a 15-minute walk down the path to Pozo Azul, a swimming hole. The first swimming hole was packed. We crossed this area (you have to walk through the water, so we had to take our socks and sneakers off and then put them back on) and hiked up to the second swimming hole, which was less crowded and a bit deeper. We watched teenage boys jump off the high cliff before we jumped off a slightly lower cliff :). We hiked just a little bit farther up to another swimming hole that was virtually empty, where we sat and read for a bit. There are no amenities here, save for a couple ladies grilling plantains at the entrance, so come prepared. Finca Victoria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe debated hiking up to Finca Victoria from Pozo Azul or taking a moto-taxi but ultimately walked up and took a moto-taxi back down. This hike up is very steep and challenging, but with beautiful views. We speed-walked (as much as we could uphill) and it took us 50 minutes from the start of the path to Pozo Azul. We started with lunch at the restaurant attached to the farm (see above) before our tour. There\u2019s no tour schedule, they just take you around whenever you\u2019re ready, maybe waiting to see if a couple more people show up. The tour costs $15,000 pesos and includes a cup of their coffee. La Victoria has been around since 1892 and uses water and gravity to power their automatic production of coffee beans. It\u2019s pretty impressive and we learned a lot from our knowledgeable tour guide.Chill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially if you\u2019re coming to Minca from a big city, this is a good time to relax. Life seems pretty laid-back here, and our hostel was a great place to catch up on reading, play cards, and take in the views while surrounded by nature.Moto-taxiAs mentioned, we took a moto-taxi back to our hostel from Finca Victoria. Look for the guys in black polos with blue writing; these are the official Minca moto-taxi drivers. It\u2019s a fun experience, just hold on tight!  We were only in Minca for two nights so didn\u2019t get to do everything. Here are a few other activities we read about on the blog Practical Wanderlust: Las PiedrasLas Cascadas de MarinkaFinca La CandelariaShoppingStayCasa Loma Minca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were really happy with our decision to stay at Casa Loma. As I mentioned a couple times above, people who aren\u2019t even sleeping there come up for meals and the sunset because they have so much to offer. They have a number of different types of accommodations including private rooms, open-air huts, dorms, hammocks, and tents. We chose the Casa Luna hut for its views and its private bathroom (the only one offered). This hut is secluded from the rest of the camp and has a wide open view of the mountains, plus the night sky full of stars - something you don\u2019t get in New York City! The shower has the same view, which was pretty amazing. The hut has a mosquito net over the bed and a big wooden locker, which we put all our stuff in when not using, including toiletries, for security and to keep animals away. The hut has a curtain in lieu of a door, and the noises we heard in the night took some getting used to, but waking up and going to bed with that view was worth it. Even though we stayed in the secluded hut with our own bathroom, we took advantage of the benefits of staying in a hostel, such as group dinners and meeting other travelers. We enjoyed sitting in the hammocks and at the picnic tables in the main lodge playing cards and reading. If you can manage the hike up to Casa Loma from town, I recommend booking a room here!EAT AND DO IN MINCA - MAP VIEW\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nALL COLOMBIA BLOG POSTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2019\n\n\n\nColombia, Minca, Minca activities, To Do\n\n\n\nVisiting Minca, Colombia\n\n\n\nApr 6, 2019\n\n\n\nColombia, Minca, Minca activities, To Do\n\n\nOn my recent trip to Colombia with my sister, we spent a couple nights in Minca, which is in the mountains a few hours north of Cartagena.

The burger fell apart a bit, though taste wise it was fine.\n\nThe margaritas were outstanding as was rhe barmaid that glanced for approval.\nThe mojitos are average - I'd recommend going to KHITAJO GASTROBAR for a fab mojito + their mincacao is divine.\n\nNice background music.Carl Mendes \u2014 Google reviewFantastic menu with lots of different tastes - THAT ALL WERE GREAT.

It is to be noted that I was given a choice from three bottles of various red wine - on three price levels each being 10000 COP in difference\u2026 which I think to be superb giving the diner a choice in that circumstance. The pizza was a good size for a medium and enough that I took half away with me. Super experience and great taste!Stirling Vagabond \u2014 Google reviewNice restaurant with great food.

Dishes were very good size, and a medium pizza is enough for two people while a large is good for 3. The pasta were flavorful, and large but sauce tasted a bit watery. Serv\u00ed e was quick and attentive, and we had the whole upper floor to ourselves. Not the cheapest option in town. Oh also, the chicken fajita on the menu is just a burrito, so don't expect anything different. Overall, really good dinner.samuel dean \u2014 Google reviewVery surprised as my partner is Italian and have high standards I guess - super tasty pastas!

Super tasty, fresh and great presentation. The chef has definitely tried to be creative, and make a food with a twist. We had the wraps and a salad, both outstanding. One of the best food we had on our travel. They deserve more crowd. We highly recommend this place. And this comes from two chefs from London. Well done \ud83d\ude0aElena Smileva \u2014 Google reviewWorst meal of our lives. Horrible service and attitude...wait staff rolling eyes. Asked specifically for patacones and they gave us fried sweet banana, ordered a bacon burger and came with no bacon, asked for no milk or cheese with my mushrooms and they served me raw undercooked mushrooms submerged in cheesy watery soup, the chicken seemed as if they microwaved it. Overcharged for the tiny portion. Addressed the issue and there was no apologies. Got diarrea after. Not sure if the people staffing at the moment were the owners but whoever was there were non-shalant and careless, did not welcome us and despite the basic request from the menu they decided to make whatever they felt like rather than acknowledging what was on the description of our order. Would not recommend this place for anyone.Hanna Casta?eda \u2014 Google reviewWe wanted food to go and the chef came out to talk to us about all the options. We ended up getting chicken and cheese sandwiches with mushrooms cooked in wine-so tasty!

Typical Colombian dishes which are well prepared for a fair price ; many of the other places are either wanna-be fancy or just have international kitchen. The terrace is also quite nice and you can observe street life whilst eating. I ate there twice during my stay and I was happy. Thanks :)Daniel Felix Volkmann \u2014 Google reviewThe food took long to get service. The fish was small, the vegetarian sandwich was so so.

It is a climb to get here but part of the experience if you didn't overpack and fit.James L \u2014 Google reviewI just wish I could have stayed longer here. Its a very beautiful hostel, the views of Minca and Santa Marta are incredible. It seemed to be doing great business as we wanted to extrnd our stay but it was booked out! The staff are amazing, I only got one of their names Tanya who was the front desk was really nice and helpful. The owner Stefan was so sound and we had great chats.\n\nThe atomsphere of the place seems very open minded and free. All the food in the restaurant is vegetarian and loads of vegan options. The food was amazing.\n\nYou must climb a relatively steep hill to get up there so please be aware of this, but it means that you get the best views of the sunset.\n\nTheres also yoga studio and spa treatments which i should have availed of.\n\nLastly, theres kittens there at the moment and they are ADORABLE.\n\nAll of these factors made it probably my favourite hostel ive stayed in!!! Thanks for the stay \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9aConnie Colgan \u2014 Google reviewLOVED my stay here, did not want to leave. I booked Casa Luna for 3 nights, which is in the far back with it's own private shower and bathroom, so my experience with the room may be different than those who stayed in dorms/hammocks but I found the room very comfortable and clean. I had plenty of space and the outdoor bathroom was super clean, as were the communal bathrooms by reception. The vibe here is amazing, everyones gathers on the deck for sunsets and it's a great chance to meet other travelers. Food was great, I had breakfast here everyday and dinner twice and beers are cheap. You can't beat the views and the music was always perfect. They cut the music around 9pm so it's easy to go to bed early. The hike up the hill to get there isn't easy but it's doable and worth it. I liked that this hostel was up in the hills but didn't require a moto taxi to get to from town. The staff was amazing at this hostel and I even got a massage and facial from Melissa, highly recommend! If you're not into bugs, don't stay here, but if you want an incredible experience in Minca and are looking to meet others I cannot recommend Casa Loma enough.Colleen McCreesh \u2014 Google reviewThe view is spectacular! I would just book a room here to see the amazing sunsets here!\nI didn't stay here, but i did enjoyed some lovely sunsets here.\nThey also have live music here, yoga in the morning and a very good vegetarian menu.\nThe hike upthere is quiet difficult, but soooo worth it!Marije Van Neck \u2014 Google reviewThis is a special place for those active travelers who are looking for a relaxing reprieve from the cities. It's a steep 450 meter (1/4 mile) climb from the road, but you arrive to stunning views of the mountains, Santa Marta, and ocean below. The elevation provides access to a nice breeze and the vibe is a relaxed yoga atmosphere with shared reading spaces and communal areas to mingle with other travelers.\nThe rooms are rustic. You don't come here to hang out in your room. You come here to lounge in the open air spaces and simply sleep in the room. We had a double bed hut. The bug netting was clean and adequate to protect from the bugs. The bed was comfy and clean. The shared toilets are well lit and surprisingly clean.Jesse Sellars \u2014 Google reviewWe really enjoyed our stay at Casa Loma. The food and views were excellent. The hike up wasn\u2019t too tough. Tania helped us so much when we were there as we had to moves rooms a few times due to us booking separate nights. Our stay was excellent, thank you Taniamegan wilson \u2014 Google reviewI booked 2 nights, stayed 10 days. I loved the atmosphere of the place. I would especially like to mention my gratitude to the amazing staff.\n\nUnfortunately I don't remember all the names of the amazing staff, that worked there. The ones I kept in my brain were Jeremias and Ray, who did an outstanding Job at the bar. Always friendly and up for a nice chat.\n\nAlso Guillermo was amazing. After a couple of days he made me feel at home and it felt like a true friendship. Thanks for the moments and conversations galactic brother.\n\nI am very happy to have stayed in casa Loma. Especially nice was the atmosphere with the staff. It did not feel, that they would just work there, it felt that I visit their home. So much passion, customer service and honesty. Please don't change! I will always keep this place and you in my heart.Max B. \u2014 Google reviewThis place is very beautiful, however, I would recommend staying somewhere else and just coming for sunset and drinks as the rooms are not worth the money. The vibe is cool but it was very hard to sleep at night - as you are outside there is a lot of bugs, they blasted music until 4am whilst I was there and then staff were speaking very loudly outside the dorm at 7:30am.\n\nPros:\nVeggie food good and reasonably priced\nDrinks reasonable too\nSetting and sunset is amazing\n\nCons:\nBeds are expensive and very basic\nSteep uphill climb to get to it, which was really horrible with our bags\nRooms are very basic/outdoors which is fine but it\u2019s really loud at night\nAmenities could be improvedFredie Sharp \u2014 Google reviewcalle 1 #No 5, Minca, Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia\u2022https://hotels.cloudbeds.com/reservation/bUfRkK15RESTAURANTE ASADERO CAMARITASaveSlide 1 of 44.4(100)\u20224.5(8)RestaurantSlide 1 of 3Magical experience and best food in Minca.Tom Tenney \u2014 Google reviewI was probably the only foreigner in this restaurant.

My plate did not have potatoes like offered in the menu, the waiter said they are out of stock. After complaining they brought me potatoes within 2 minutes. I paid more than offered in the menu. Maybe prices in the menu are not up-to-date. The pork ribs were only fat, no real meat. I did not order pork belly. The only thing which was good, was the view.Lukas \u2014 Google reviewUnique!

We had to wait 90 minutes for our food which was cold when it finally arrived. We ordered 1 beer and after a while we wanted to order another one but no one was coming up to our table. After an hour I got up to ask for another beer at the bar and they acted annoyed. Also, stray dogs and cats were constantly getting in begging for food and some were agressive.

It\u2019s highly popular with travelers due to its relaxed atmosphere, beautiful landscapes and excellent hostels. However, many visitors don\u2019t have weeks to enjoy chilling out in the village, so here\u2019s a quick guide on how to make the most of 48 hours in Minca.          View All Trips        Arriving at lunchtime from Santa Marta, the first thing to do is grab a bite to eat in town, and there\u2019s nowhere better to do that than at The Lazy Cat, a great little restaurant just opposite the village church, which overlooks the river and serves the best burgers and burritos in town. Then wander across the bridge towards Cafe Minca for a local coffee. Even if you\u2019re not staying there, the adjacent Hotel Minca is worth a visit to enjoy their amazing hummingbird feeders, which attract an array of the colorful little birds.

The best place in town to stay is the delightful Casa Loma Hostel, which is perched on a hillside above the village and commands amazing views over the distant Caribbean Sea and the gorgeous green mountains. Check in here, order a delicious vegan dinner for the evening, then spend the rest of your first day relaxing, enjoying the view and waiting for the sunset. Casa Loma has the best sunset views in town, and there\u2019s even a great happy hour to make the evening pass even quicker. Get an early night, because there\u2019s a lot to do tomorrow.     Wake up nice and early (it\u2019s much cooler and fresher in the morning), and head down into Minca to grab a mototaxi up into the mountains to La Victoria Coffee Farm. This working coffee farm is one of the oldest in Colombia and offers a fascinating glimpse at the old machinery once used to harvest the magic little beans, which is still in use today! Take the tour at La Victoria in the morning, then stick around for lunch to enjoy one of their delicious sandwiches and an ice cold Happy Toucan Beer, which is also brewed on site. After lunch, walk back towards Minca from the farm along the road towards Pozos Naturales (grab another mototaxi if you\u2019re not the hiking type).

View Trip            Coffee drying at La Victoria in Minca | \u00a9 Chris Bell / The Culture Trip                Pozos Naturales is a lovely little swimming hole on the river between La Victoria and Minca, and is the perfect place to enjoy a refreshing dip in the cooling waters of the Sierra Nevada (don\u2019t forget to pack your bathing suit when you leave in the morning). There are many stalls along the road from the Pozos to Minca, where you can sample local chocolate and honey products, and enjoy the mountain views. Always keep an eye out for Toucans as well: they are commonly seen along this road. Grab some dinner in Minca \u2013 you\u2019re forgiven if you choose The Lazy Cat again \u2013 and head back up to Casa Loma: there\u2019s still the happy hour to look forward to!     On your final morning, rise nice and early and meet up with Jungle Joe down in the village \u2013 he offers excellent beginner\u2019s birding tours on the trails around the village and is the perfect man with whom to discover the feathered joys of the Santa Marta Mountains. You can see toucans, parrots, owls, woodpeckers and much more with Joe, and he\u2019s a patient and understandable guide. You\u2019ll be finished by 9:30 am, which gives you a couple more hours to enjoy: hop on a quick mototaxi and head to Marinka Waterfalls to enjoy a last cooling dip in the river, before you head back down the mountains to the sweltering heat of the coast.

But Minca was by far my favourite. Its prime location among the Sierra Nevada\u2019s verdant mountaintops, the abundance of magical waterfalls and its endearing village charm stopped me in my tracks, and for a few more days than I had planned. There are so many exciting things to do in Minca, Colombia, you might end up extending your stay here too!\nJust a few years ago, this Colombian village was considered off the beaten path. Now it\u2019s on the radar. But it\u2019s still no gringolandia. It has retained its small-town allure, and the addition of a few new hipster cafes, restaurants and hostels make anyone\u2019s experience in Minca, Colombia, all the more magical. Plus, visiting Minca also means you get to say you visited the highest coastal range in the world, because the Sierra Nevada is, well, just that!\nIn this post, we\u2019ll dive into everything from what to do in Minca, how long you should stay, how to get to Minca, and where to eat in Minca. Get your travel planner out and ready!\n\nHow long should I stay in Minca?\nWhile most people only choose to spend about 2 days in Minca, there are plenty of things to do in this sleepy mountain town to keep you fully occupied for a week.\nHowever long you choose to stay here, use this list of the best things to do in Minca, Colombia, to help you plan your visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinca\u2019s main street\n\n\n\n\nHow to get to Minca, Colombia?\nIf you\u2019re wondering how to get to Minca, Colombia, you\u2019ll be glad to know it\u2019s not that difficult.\nThe cheapest way to get there is to hop on a bus from Santa Marta. Buses leave from the main square and will set you back 9\u2019000 COP per person. It\u2019s a short 1-hour journey, but you do have to wait for the bus to fill up before it leaves. The last bus also leaves at 5 pm.\nAlso bear in mind the location of where you\u2019re staying. If it\u2019s not in the village, you\u2019ll have to pay extra for a motorbike to take you there.\nThe other option is to get a taxi. This is the best option if there are a few of you or if you\u2019ve missed the last bus. The going rate is about 60\u2019000 COP, but you can easily get it for 50\u2019000 COP. It\u2019s always worth negotiating!\nYou may also enjoy: How to Haggle Abroad: 18 Useful Tips to Become a Haggling Master\n\n14 Things to do in Minca, Colombia\nVisit the Marinka Waterfalls\nWalk along a muddy track for about an hour and you\u2019ll eventually make it to the Marinka Waterfalls. If you\u2019re feeling lazy, you can just pay a motorbike to take you for about 10\u2019000 COP.\nEntry is 10\u2019000 COP at the time of this writing and gives you access to a jungle garden and two pretty big waterfalls. The first one is the biggest, and you\u2019ll feel its fine spray from a hundred metres away. This waterfall is the most majestic.\nThe second waterfall is the best one for swimming in! Just bear in mind that it can get quite busy in the plunge pool.\nThere are a lot of big hammock seats in the Marinka waterfall gardens \u2013 you\u2019ll definitely want to get a cool picture in one!\nThere\u2019s also a restaurant on site that serves up delicious food for a good price!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more majestic of the Marinka Waterfalls\n\n\n\n\nO\u00eddo del Mundo\nIf you\u2019re walking to Marinka Waterfalls, you\u2019ll pass O\u00eddo del Mundo. These are a smaller and supposedly less impressive set of waterfalls that precede Marinka, but they\u2019re much less crowded, and there\u2019s often no one there!\nVisiting O\u00eddo del Mundo is one of the best things to do in Minca, Colombia, if you really want to swim and enjoy the tranquillity of nature around you.\nI\u2019m a bit of a sucker for swimming in river water; it\u2019s always way too cold for me. The funny thing is, I didn\u2019t find the water to be that cold here. Owing to the smaller size of the waterfall, you can swim right up to it and sit right under the crashing water. Yes, it may be a bit of a throttling experience, but coming out of it makes you feel refreshed and rejuvenated!\nOf all the waterfalls in Minca, Colombia, O\u00eddo del Mundo is my favourite!Trending11 Things I Wish I knew Before Hiking Acatenango Volcano\nYou might also enjoy: Visiting Tayrona National Park in Colombia: The Ultimate Guide\n\nPlay board games at Casa Loma\nThere are a few hostels in Minca that are well-known for offering visitors incredible experiences. Casa Loma is one of those, and the best bit is, it\u2019s a short trek from the village centre.\nOnce you\u2019ve managed to hike up the mountainside to get there (15 minutes max!), you\u2019ll be rewarded with mountain and sea views reaching all the way out to Santa Marta and the Caribbean coast. You can\u2019t find a better spot to watch the sunset from this close to the village!\nThey also have a big selection of different board games in the main outdoor common area that anyone can play. The common area layout means it\u2019s also very easy to meet other travellers.\nI\u2019m also a massive fan of their vegan and vegetarian food. Everything on the menu tastes incredible, and for a bit of a gringo hostel, the prices are super economical. If you\u2019re looking for a chilled evening, a visit to Casa Loma must be on any list of things to do in Minca, Colombia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasa Loma\u2019s common area\n\n\n\n\nTry unicycling\nAbout two-thirds of the way up to Casa Loma, you\u2019ll pass a circus master\u2019s house. He offers aerial acrobatics, slackline and unicycle classes that you can try out for a fraction of the price as in other countries.\nIf you\u2019re wondering what to do in Minca, Colombia, that isn\u2019t hiking or waterfalls, this might be for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nGo on a coffee and cacao tour\nThe mountains around Santa Marta are some of the best in the country when it comes to producing coffee and cacao. A trip to Minca is therefore a perfect excuse to learn more about the harvesting and production process of both of these brown beans.\nThere are a few places you can do a tour. Finca La Candelaria and Finca San Rafael both do coffee and cacao tours. You can combine them or just do one. If you just want a coffee tour, you can also visit La Victoria.\nFor my cacao tour, I visited Finca San Rafael. I could not have been more impressed. Included in the tour, I was given a cacao face mask to smoother all over my face, paired with the most delicious cup of cold hot chocolate I\u2019ve ever had. There are only two places I\u2019ve ever tried hot chocolate and liked it; Finca San Rafael and Oaxaca, Mexico.\u00a0\nGoing on a coffee or cacao tour is one of the best things to do in Minca, Colombia. But whatever finca you decide to go to, they\u2019re all very out of the way. You either have to walk for a few hours to get there or pay for a motorbike to take you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLounge in a giant hammock at Sierra Minca\nRemember I mentioned earlier about some of the best hostels in Minca? Well, this is another one of them. Maybe even the best. There are a few places in and around Minca that allow you to sit in their suspended hammocks, but none are quite as big as the ones they have at Sierra Minca.\nFor a small entrance fee, you can enjoy the phenomenal mountain and sea views from their gigantic hammocks and spend a whole morning here. The only downside is that Sierra Minca is quite a long motorbike ride out of Minca. That\u2019s code for expensive. But if you\u2019re wondering what to do in Minca to chill, this might just be it.\n\nDrink cocktails at the Lazy Cat\nWondering what to do in Minca, Colombia, at night? Go and grab a cocktail!\nYou\u2019ll find The Lazy Cat on Minca\u2019s main street. It\u2019s the ideal spot to end your day of adventuring by splashing out on a few ridiculously cheap cocktails. Colombians are so friendly that you\u2019ll also more than likely end your night here with a couple of new friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking friends with a new four-legged pal\n\n\n\n\nVisit Pozo Azul waterfall\nThe truth is, the area around Minca is blessed with an abundance of waterfalls.\nPozo Azul is a 2-hour walk from the centre of Minca and you can either walk it, or pay for a motorbike to take you.\nHere you can go for a swim in the VERY cold river water and enjoy the waterfall from afar. There\u2019s a risk of getting pulled under the closer you get to the falls, so unfortunately you can\u2019t swim past the rope barrier. Regardless of that, it\u2019s a fun place to cool off, splash about and spend a few hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPozo Azul Waterfall\n\n\n\n\nHike to a viewpoint\nWhen you ask most people about going on hikes in Minca, they\u2019ll surely tell you about the Los Pinos viewpoint hike. It\u2019s one of the lengthier hikes in Minca, taking about 4 hours to get there from the village.\nBut the views are more than worth it! If you\u2019re very lucky, you may run into a motorbike on the way down that\u2019ll take you back for a fee. If not, it\u2019s another 3 hours walk down to the village.\nBut now for the best hike in Minca; the 360\u00ba viewpoint hike. Not only is this one much more unheard of, but it\u2019s also a lot closer. It only takes 2 hours to get there (although it is steep!), and you\u2019ll probably have the place to yourself! If you\u2019re looking for hikes in Minca, don\u2019t skip this one!\nAs the name suggests, the views from up here are unparalleled. Who says no to a 360\u00ba view of mountains, sea and luscious forest?! Hike up in the afternoon so you can watch the sunset for an extra special experience. For those wondering what to do in Minca, Colombia, with an abundance of energy, this is for you!\nUse this guide to help you get there.\n\nStop for ice cream in Waira\nOn the way back from your Marinka waterfall hike, you\u2019ll pass by Waira, a chic ice cream and coffee shop.\u00a0I had the best ice cream I\u2019ve had in all of Colombia here!\nThey have some very funky ice cream flavours, from intense chocolate made with organic cacao to dragon blood and even lavender sorbet! The cakes they have up on display will also make your mouth drool. It\u2019s best to come here on an empty stomach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur huge portions of cacao and dragon\u2019s blood ice cream\n\n\n\n\nGo to the cinema\nYep, you read that right. Minca has its very own cinema. Ask in La Miga bakery for more information on what movies are being shown and the times.\nThe only downside is they normally only show them in Spanish, so it\u2019s not ideal for everyone.\n\nGo birdwatching\nColombia is the most biodiverse country in the world per square kilometre. Knowing that, it\u2019s unsurprising that it\u2019s also the second most biodiverse country in the world when it comes to birds.\nMinca is one of the best places to go birdwatching in the country. Even if you\u2019re not the biggest bird enthusiast (I\u2019m not!), going on a bird-watching tour with Jungle Joe will bring the bird passionista out of you!\nIf you can muster the courage to wake up in time for the 6 am start, Joe will fill you in with all sorts of incredible bird and wildlife facts and point out some very cool and funky birds you otherwise never would have noticed. I\u2019m talking hummingbirds, toucans and macaws!\nDespite having to roll out of my bed at 5 am, this was one of my favourite activities in Minca, Colombia. And for only 50\u2019000 COP per person, it\u2019s a steal!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJungle Joe\u2019s bird watching tour\n\n\n\n\nGo on a motorcycle ride\nThere are a lot of hikes in Minca, which equates to a lot of walking. You might like to treat yourself to a motorbike ride and then walk back from somewhere to make things easier.\nPlus, motorbike rides in and of themselves are one of the most fun things to do in Minca, Colombia! The tracks in the area are often bumpy and sea-saw-like in terms of their ascents and descents, so whizzing around the muddy mountain paths on a motorbike can be quite a thrilling experience!\nJust beware that it\u2019s not common for you to be given a helmet unless you ask for a rider that\u2019s willing to lend you theirs.\nYou might also enjoy: A Backpacker\u2019s Guide to Palomino, Colombia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreat yourself to a chocolate massage\nOkay, this is definitely not one of the most budget-friendly things to do in Minca, but your tired backpack-carrying back will thank you for it later.\nCasa Loma offers a selection of different massages in their very peaceful open-air jungle massage room. If I recall correctly, they offered energy, wood, hot stone, and chocolate massages, all for about 120\u2019000 COP.\nSince Minca is a big cacao-producing region, I opted for the one-hour chocolate massage for 120\u2019000 COP. It\u2019s the only massage I\u2019ve ever had, and I\u2019m coming back for more!\nIf you\u2019re wondering what to do in Minca, Colombia, to really really relax and unwind, this is it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasa Loma\u2019s relaxing jungle massage room\n\n\n\n\nWhere to eat in Minca\nOver the last few years, Minca has grown to have quite a number of restaurants, cafes and bakeries popping up all over the village centre. A lot of them are also vegan and vegetarian-friendly.\nAlthough you might not be able to try them all, I visited 80% of them for you. Here are my favourites\u2026\nCasa Aney \nThis is without a doubt my favourite place to eat in Minca. The place is run by an Israeli and serves up really yummy pizza and lots of different Middle Eastern dips like hummus, babbaganoush and tzatziki. They also sell homemade kombucha (ask for a behind-the-scenes tour of where it\u2019s made!) and a mouth-wateringly delicious seaweed salad.\nIn the evening, lots of candles come out turning it into the most romantic date spot in the village!\nMake sure you visit Casa Aney as one of your things to do in Minca, Colombia. I visited on my last night so I only had the chance to GO there once. I was so gutted that I couldn\u2019t visit again.\nIf you\u2019re wondering what to do in Minca, Colombia, at night, go and eat in Casa Aney!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the best food I had in Colombia\n\n\n\n\nDuni\nAt the foot of the hike to Casa Loma (just off the village\u2019s park), you\u2019ll see Duni tucked away in a corner. This is another vegan-friendly place that serves up scrumptious breakfasts and has some really yummy baked treats. I recommend the brownie and the cheese and spinach rolls.\n\nCasa Loma\nI mentioned this place before, but it deserves mentioning again. Casa Loma\u2019s restaurant serves up a whole array of different foods from burgers, to lasagna, salad bowls and delicious desserts. The best bit is, it\u2019s all plant-based, and every single dish is a treat to your taste buds (and your wallet!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA wholesome start to the day at Casa Loma\n\n\n\n\nMarhaba\nThis is another place serving up middle eastern flavours and falafel plates. You can also indulge in one of their tasty pizzas on one of their wooden stools overlooking the street. This is a great little spot, but if you want hummus, Casa Aney does it better.\nIf you were wondering where to eat in Minca, hopefully, this list has helped a bit!\n\nWhere to stay in Minca\nCASA LOMA \u2013 If you\u2019re looking for a hostel that\u2019s not too far from the village but still has an in-the-middle-of-nowhere feel to it, Casa Loma is your best bet. Just a 15-minute hike up from Minca village, it boasts panoramic views over a thriving green mountain landscape and as far out as the city of Santa Marta. The wooden hilltop house also has lots of common areas with swing chairs and board games, plus they have live music on the weekends and daily yoga classes. This is definitely one of my go-to hostels in Minca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunset views from Casa Loma\n\n\n\n\nSIERRA MINCA \u2013 Hostel views don\u2019t get much better than the ones at Sierra Minca. It\u2019s home to the largest hammocks in the world and a pool with unrivalled views over the mountains. But for all of these benefits, you do have to sacrifice your proximity to Minca village. Because of this, you\u2019re very reliant on the services they provide. Motorbike taxis take about 30 minutes to get to the hostel, which will set you back at least 20\u2019000 COP for each journey. Visiting Sierra Minca is one of the top things to do in Minca, Colombia, though. So if you don\u2019t stay here, you can still visit for a day!\nFINCA CARPE DIEM \u2013 If you\u2019re interested in staying in an eco-lodge while in Minca, this is my top pick. While it\u2019s not actually in Minca (it\u2019s in the nearby village area of Paso del Mango), this is a very recommendable place to stay if you want to be surrounded by rivers, mountains and forests. Come here for wild, untamed nature and a few days of being disconnected (or more connected you could say).\nLA GUACAMAYA \u2013 While I wouldn\u2019t say this is one of the best hostels in Minca, it\u2019s definitely one of the cheapest. The dorm room is super basic, but you only pay 20\u2019000 COP per night, and it\u2019s right in the centre of Minca village. They also have a pet macaw here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHostel La Guacamaya\u2019s friendly macaw\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do in Minca, Colombia: a summary\nAnddddd\u2026that\u2019s a wrap.

I read of this place while I was doing some research. At first I thought it was only a burger restaurant but they have much more. Andrea was our server and she was great and very attentive. Definitely stop here. I highly recommend the ceviche!KD San \u2014 Google reviewIt is a nice and not too expensive place to go. They offer hamburgers, wraps, sandwiches, steaks and vegan food.

The burger fell apart a bit, though taste wise it was fine.\n\nThe margaritas were outstanding as was rhe barmaid that glanced for approval.\nThe mojitos are average - I'd recommend going to KHITAJO GASTROBAR for a fab mojito + their mincacao is divine.\n\nNice background music.Carl Mendes \u2014 Google reviewFantastic menu with lots of different tastes - THAT ALL WERE GREAT.

It is to be noted that I was given a choice from three bottles of various red wine - on three price levels each being 10000 COP in difference\u2026 which I think to be superb giving the diner a choice in that circumstance. The pizza was a good size for a medium and enough that I took half away with me. Super experience and great taste!Stirling Vagabond \u2014 Google reviewNice restaurant with great food.

I recommend!Sana Chantor \u2014 Google reviewVery good rating on google so we decided to give it a try. Dishes were very good size, and a medium pizza is enough for two people while a large is good for 3. The pasta were flavorful, and large but sauce tasted a bit watery. Serv\u00ed e was quick and attentive, and we had the whole upper floor to ourselves. Not the cheapest option in town. Oh also, the chicken fajita on the menu is just a burrito, so don't expect anything different. Overall, really good dinner.samuel dean \u2014 Google reviewVery surprised as my partner is Italian and have high standards I guess - super tasty pastas!

Elkin was our waiter and he took very good care of us. Great location, just a little way down the road, with a great decor. We ate outside on the patio overlooking the road. I loved the glass bottle lamps, and the fruit drinks Elkin recommended were incredible!Luz Pinilla \u2014 Google reviewAmazing good food without doubling the price for tourists.

We had the ribs and the picanha there. They provided us with an included starter which was very nice. The ribs were perfect, very tender and the sauce was delicious! The picanha was also very good, it was a tender and juicy piece of meat.\nThe place located next to a river, so when you go there for dinner better carry some repellent as the mosquitos will eat you.

I tried the Nutella with banana + ice cream and was glad. The portion is quite large for a dessert so it's shareable or you could just eat it as a meal like I did. The place appears small from the outside but it could sit quite a few people. The staff was really friendly and they have English or Spanish menu.Lucy \u2014 Google reviewAn absolute gem of a place in Minca. We headed there for the 5pm-7pm happy hour with $10000  burgers and $5000 cups of wine.\n\nThat burger was sitting between a couple of clouds of deliciousness. Never have I had such a fresh burger bun before. It was served with a handful of freshly cut chips and the wine was absolutely perfect.\n\nCustomer service was top notch and we had a great night.

One of the best food we had on our travel. They deserve more crowd. We highly recommend this place. And this comes from two chefs from London. Well done \ud83d\ude0aElena Smileva \u2014 Google reviewWorst meal of our lives. Horrible service and attitude...wait staff rolling eyes. Asked specifically for patacones and they gave us fried sweet banana, ordered a bacon burger and came with no bacon, asked for no milk or cheese with my mushrooms and they served me raw undercooked mushrooms submerged in cheesy watery soup, the chicken seemed as if they microwaved it. Overcharged for the tiny portion. Addressed the issue and there was no apologies. Got diarrea after. Not sure if the people staffing at the moment were the owners but whoever was there were non-shalant and careless, did not welcome us and despite the basic request from the menu they decided to make whatever they felt like rather than acknowledging what was on the description of our order. Would not recommend this place for anyone.Hanna Casta?eda \u2014 Google reviewWe wanted food to go and the chef came out to talk to us about all the options.

Its a very beautiful hostel, the views of Minca and Santa Marta are incredible. It seemed to be doing great business as we wanted to extrnd our stay but it was booked out! The staff are amazing, I only got one of their names Tanya who was the front desk was really nice and helpful. The owner Stefan was so sound and we had great chats.\n\nThe atomsphere of the place seems very open minded and free. All the food in the restaurant is vegetarian and loads of vegan options. The food was amazing.\n\nYou must climb a relatively steep hill to get up there so please be aware of this, but it means that you get the best views of the sunset.\n\nTheres also yoga studio and spa treatments which i should have availed of.\n\nLastly, theres kittens there at the moment and they are ADORABLE.\n\nAll of these factors made it probably my favourite hostel ive stayed in!!! Thanks for the stay \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9aConnie Colgan \u2014 Google reviewLOVED my stay here, did not want to leave. I booked Casa Luna for 3 nights, which is in the far back with it's own private shower and bathroom, so my experience with the room may be different than those who stayed in dorms/hammocks but I found the room very comfortable and clean. I had plenty of space and the outdoor bathroom was super clean, as were the communal bathrooms by reception. The vibe here is amazing, everyones gathers on the deck for sunsets and it's a great chance to meet other travelers. Food was great, I had breakfast here everyday and dinner twice and beers are cheap. You can't beat the views and the music was always perfect. They cut the music around 9pm so it's easy to go to bed early. The hike up the hill to get there isn't easy but it's doable and worth it. I liked that this hostel was up in the hills but didn't require a moto taxi to get to from town. The staff was amazing at this hostel and I even got a massage and facial from Melissa, highly recommend! If you're not into bugs, don't stay here, but if you want an incredible experience in Minca and are looking to meet others I cannot recommend Casa Loma enough.Colleen McCreesh \u2014 Google reviewThe view is spectacular! I would just book a room here to see the amazing sunsets here!\nI didn't stay here, but i did enjoyed some lovely sunsets here.\nThey also have live music here, yoga in the morning and a very good vegetarian menu.\nThe hike upthere is quiet difficult, but soooo worth it!Marije Van Neck \u2014 Google reviewThis is a special place for those active travelers who are looking for a relaxing reprieve from the cities. It's a steep 450 meter (1/4 mile) climb from the road, but you arrive to stunning views of the mountains, Santa Marta, and ocean below. The elevation provides access to a nice breeze and the vibe is a relaxed yoga atmosphere with shared reading spaces and communal areas to mingle with other travelers.\nThe rooms are rustic. You don't come here to hang out in your room. You come here to lounge in the open air spaces and simply sleep in the room. We had a double bed hut. The bug netting was clean and adequate to protect from the bugs. The bed was comfy and clean. The shared toilets are well lit and surprisingly clean.Jesse Sellars \u2014 Google reviewWe really enjoyed our stay at Casa Loma. The food and views were excellent. The hike up wasn\u2019t too tough. Tania helped us so much when we were there as we had to moves rooms a few times due to us booking separate nights.

I would especially like to mention my gratitude to the amazing staff.\n\nUnfortunately I don't remember all the names of the amazing staff, that worked there. The ones I kept in my brain were Jeremias and Ray, who did an outstanding Job at the bar. Always friendly and up for a nice chat.\n\nAlso Guillermo was amazing. After a couple of days he made me feel at home and it felt like a true friendship. Thanks for the moments and conversations galactic brother.\n\nI am very happy to have stayed in casa Loma. Especially nice was the atmosphere with the staff. It did not feel, that they would just work there, it felt that I visit their home. So much passion, customer service and honesty. Please don't change! I will always keep this place and you in my heart.Max B. \u2014 Google reviewThis place is very beautiful, however, I would recommend staying somewhere else and just coming for sunset and drinks as the rooms are not worth the money. The vibe is cool but it was very hard to sleep at night - as you are outside there is a lot of bugs, they blasted music until 4am whilst I was there and then staff were speaking very loudly outside the dorm at 7:30am.\n\nPros:\nVeggie food good and reasonably priced\nDrinks reasonable too\nSetting and sunset is amazing\n\nCons:\nBeds are expensive and very basic\nSteep uphill climb to get to it, which was really horrible with our bags\nRooms are very basic/outdoors which is fine but it\u2019s really loud at night\nAmenities could be improvedFredie Sharp \u2014 Google reviewcalle 1 #No 5, Minca, Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia\u2022https://hotels.cloudbeds.com/reservation/bUfRkK15RESTAURANTE ASADERO CAMARITASaveSlide 1 of 44.4(100)\u20224.5(8)RestaurantSlide 1 of 3Magical experience and best food in Minca.Tom Tenney \u2014 Google reviewI was probably the only foreigner in this restaurant.

It\u2019s highly popular with travelers due to its relaxed atmosphere, beautiful landscapes and excellent hostels. However, many visitors don\u2019t have weeks to enjoy chilling out in the village, so here\u2019s a quick guide on how to make the most of 48 hours in Minca.          View All Trips        Arriving at lunchtime from Santa Marta, the first thing to do is grab a bite to eat in town, and there\u2019s nowhere better to do that than at The Lazy Cat, a great little restaurant just opposite the village church, which overlooks the river and serves the best burgers and burritos in town. Then wander across the bridge towards Cafe Minca for a local coffee. Even if you\u2019re not staying there, the adjacent Hotel Minca is worth a visit to enjoy their amazing hummingbird feeders, which attract an array of the colorful little birds.

The best place in town to stay is the delightful Casa Loma Hostel, which is perched on a hillside above the village and commands amazing views over the distant Caribbean Sea and the gorgeous green mountains. Check in here, order a delicious vegan dinner for the evening, then spend the rest of your first day relaxing, enjoying the view and waiting for the sunset. Casa Loma has the best sunset views in town, and there\u2019s even a great happy hour to make the evening pass even quicker. Get an early night, because there\u2019s a lot to do tomorrow.     Wake up nice and early (it\u2019s much cooler and fresher in the morning), and head down into Minca to grab a mototaxi up into the mountains to La Victoria Coffee Farm. This working coffee farm is one of the oldest in Colombia and offers a fascinating glimpse at the old machinery once used to harvest the magic little beans, which is still in use today! Take the tour at La Victoria in the morning, then stick around for lunch to enjoy one of their delicious sandwiches and an ice cold Happy Toucan Beer, which is also brewed on site. After lunch, walk back towards Minca from the farm along the road towards Pozos Naturales (grab another mototaxi if you\u2019re not the hiking type).

View Trip            Coffee drying at La Victoria in Minca | \u00a9 Chris Bell / The Culture Trip                Pozos Naturales is a lovely little swimming hole on the river between La Victoria and Minca, and is the perfect place to enjoy a refreshing dip in the cooling waters of the Sierra Nevada (don\u2019t forget to pack your bathing suit when you leave in the morning). There are many stalls along the road from the Pozos to Minca, where you can sample local chocolate and honey products, and enjoy the mountain views. Always keep an eye out for Toucans as well: they are commonly seen along this road. Grab some dinner in Minca \u2013 you\u2019re forgiven if you choose The Lazy Cat again \u2013 and head back up to Casa Loma: there\u2019s still the happy hour to look forward to!     On your final morning, rise nice and early and meet up with Jungle Joe down in the village \u2013 he offers excellent beginner\u2019s birding tours on the trails around the village and is the perfect man with whom to discover the feathered joys of the Santa Marta Mountains. You can see toucans, parrots, owls, woodpeckers and much more with Joe, and he\u2019s a patient and understandable guide. You\u2019ll be finished by 9:30 am, which gives you a couple more hours to enjoy: hop on a quick mototaxi and head to Marinka Waterfalls to enjoy a last cooling dip in the river, before you head back down the mountains to the sweltering heat of the coast.

Less than an hour drive from Santa Marta, you will find yourself in a completely different environment. In Minca you can watch birds, enjoy breathtaking views, walk through coffee and cocoa plantations, visit waterfalls and go for hikes. In this travel guide you can read all my tips for things to do in Minca Colombia, including unique places to stay and restaurants.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable Of Contents\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMinca travel guide | 10 tips and things to do in Minca ColombiaGo birdwatchingVisit the waterfalls in MincaGo for hikes in Minca ColombiaVisit coffee and cocoa plantation La CandelariaEnjoy views at Mundo NuevoEnjoy a drink and meal in one of the Minca restaurants and barsTrekkers Glamping \u2013 where to stay in Minca \u00a0What to do around MincaLa Ciudad Perdida trek ColombiaMini travel guide Minca ColombiaHow long do you want to stay in Minca ColombiaHow to reach Minca in ColombiaMore about Colombia \n\n\nMinca travel guide | 10 tips and things to do in Minca Colombia\nGo birdwatching\nMinca is also called the bird paradise of Colombia and if you walk around here you immediately understand why. There is no place in the world where I saw so many hummingbirds and toucans at the same time. One of the best things to do in Minca in Colombia is therefore to go on a birdwatching tour, to understand more about the different species of birds. Moreover you will train your eyes and see so much more than going out by yourself. \u00a0\n\nMost lodges located on the mountains in Minca offer these tours. In case you are staying in Minca town, you can head out with Jungle Joe. Jungle Joe,\u00a0offers daily tours in the morning where you will explore the Minca surroundings. If you don\u2019t feel like taking a tour, promise me to get up early to spot birds yourself. You will not regret it.\nVisit the waterfalls in Minca \nThere are plenty of waterfalls around Minca in Colombia such as Cascada de Marinka, Cascada Escondida and Pozo Azul. All beautiful places but also often very busy because they can be easily reached by car. Pozo Azul is a 20-minute drive from Minca. You can also go hiking for about an hour, but you walk most of the road along a motorway. It is therefore best to take a motortaxi.\n\n\n\n\nCascada de Marinka is one the largest waterfalls and is a 30-minute drive from Minca. Cascada Escondida, one of the hidden waterfalls in Minca is less crowded. But as the name implies, is it sometime difficult to find, as you really need to know where it is (all motortaxis can help you).\nTip: If you want to visit one of these waterfalls in Minca, try to go very early in the morning and avoid weekends and holidays as much as possible. Tip 2: \u00a0On the way to Pozo Azul, you will pass Panaderia del Bosque, a lovely place for coffee, tea and cake.\nGo for hikes in Minca Colombia\nIn Minca Colombia you can go hiking all day long. It is therefore best to choose some places and include them in your trail. Just try to avoid the paved roads and walk the mountain trails instead. You will past tall trees, plants, flowers and beautiful views. Below in this Minca travel guide you will find a few things to do that are easy to reach by foot.\nTip: Are you short on time but do you want to get the maximum out of your stay? It is also possible to rent a motortaxi and have it drop you off at the different places in Minca. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit coffee and cocoa plantation La Candelaria\nLa Candelaria is a coffee and cocoa plantation, where you can go for a tour and get an explanation of the cocoa process: From seed to cup. At the end of the tour you will feel how cacoa works as a facial mask and of course there are different chocolates to taste. It is small but nice. A visit is worthwhile, if only because of the beautiful location. La Candelaria can be reached by foot from Trekker Glamping\u00a0 within 30 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy views at Mundo Nuevo\nFrom La Candelaria you can continue your journey to Mundo Nuevo. A beautiful trail through the tropical rainforest. Mundo Nuevo is again such a stunning place because of the incredible views of the surroundings. You can have a drink or visit the lower community of the Wiwa indigenous people. Just keep in mind that there are only a few houses and the residents will often hide. A visit is therefore to just get an idea of how people live and to find yourself on indigenous territory.\n\n\n\n\nTip: Do you still have energy left? Then you can follow the trail up the mountain to a viewpoint. Here you have a 360-degree view of the surroundings.\nEnjoy a drink and meal in one of the Minca restaurants and bars\nMinca in Colombia is a small village, with a church and a number of shops and restaurants. It is nice to walk around, but especially to have a meal or drink on one of the terraces, located at the river or plaza. My personal favorites are Lazy Cat, Amora and bakery La Miga.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrekkers Glamping \u2013 where to stay in Minca \u00a0\nThere are countless beautiful places to stay in Minca. But where to stay in Minca if you looking for something unique? Then spend the night at Trekker Glamping. Here you will find 5 luxuriously furnished domes, located in a natural environment. From your private terrace, you can enjoy amazing views of the jungle, Santa Marta and the Caribbean coast.\n In the next article I\u2019ll tell you more about my stay at Trekker Glamping.\n\n\n\nThe 5 domes are simple but furnished with nice materials. Each dome has its own terrace with a few chairs and a built-in hammock.\u00a0Trekker Glamping\u00a0has its own restaurant and offers different tours. Moreover it can call itself the owner of one of the most beautiful jacuzzis. \u00a0And there is nothing better than enjoying the sunset, with a cocktail in your hands, after a full day visiting the many things to do in Minca. Trekker Glamping is located halfway up the mountain and is a good startingpoint to start your hikes and discover the different things to do in Minca Colombia.\nInterested in staying at\u00a0Trekker Glamping in Minca? Check the availability and latest rates\u00a0here. Looking for more hotels in Minca? This\u00a0is an overview with hotels in Minca. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do around Minca\nLa Ciudad Perdida trek Colombia\nLooking for some adventure? Then the hike to\u00a0the Lost City in Colombia, could be a trip of a lifetime. This lost city of the Tayrona, is located in the middle of the jungle of the Sierra Nevada. The only way to reach this place, is by foot, through the jungle, for four days. You will be hiking for two full days to reach this mysterious city and afterwards you will have to return the exact same way back.\n\nThe highlight of the\u00a0La Ciudad Perdida tour\u00a0is your visit to the archaeological site. There is not much left, but you will be amazed by the colors, mystery and peacefulness, as you won\u2019t find many visitors here. But not only the destination is worth it, the landscape, lush vegetation and isolated indigenous communities along the way, will make every day of this trip unforgettable. All tours start in Santa Marta but it is also possible to be picked up in Minca. \nDo you also want to hike the Lost City? You can book your tour here. In the next article you can read everything you want to know about the Lost City trek and hike in Colombia, including a packing list + many useful tips.\nMini travel guide Minca Colombia\nHow long do you want to stay in Minca Colombia\nYou can visit Minca easily as a day trip from Santa Marta. But if you have the time, spend at least a few nights in Minca to really enjoy the nature, the nice vibe and the many things to do. I therefore recommend a minimum of 2 nights in Minca, so that you have 1 full day to explore the activities of this travel guide. \n\nTry to avoid weekends and holidays. Minca is also a popular weekend escape for the people living in the nearby cities. Especially the waterfalls in Minca will be very crowded. \u00a0\nHow to reach Minca in Colombia\nMinca in Colombia can be easily visited from Santa Marta. Depending on traffic, you can reach Minca in just 45 minutes. You can book your day tour here or take a taxi. Is your hotel, such as Trekker Glamping, located halfway up the mountain? Then it is recommended to book transportation in advance so that the pick-up is waiting for you.  Are you visiting Minca for the day? Then it is best to move around on foot or by scooter. Many motortaxis offer fixed prices and tours that take you to the different places to visit in Minca.\nCurious about what to do in Santa Marta and surroundings? In the next article you will find all my tips for things to do in Santa Marta.\n\n\n\n\nMore about Colombia\nDid you enjoy reading this Minca travel guide with tips and things to do in Minca Colombia?

It\u2019s a great place to stay before you head to Tayrona National Park or the beaches up the coast like Palomino. It is where you can rest and relax before the Ciudad Perdida (The Lost City)\u00a0or if you just want to take a break from Santa Marta. Minca Colombia is also finding its purpose and building its own reputation as an ecotourism destination.\n\nWhere is Minca Colombia?\u00a0\nMinca is a 45-minute drive from Santa Marta. Sometime this area is known as Minca Santa Marta, but correctly its Minca Magdalena as its part of the Magdalena department. It is a pleasant drive up a windy and circular 600 meter climb up the mountains of Sierra Nevada Colombia. The ride going up is scenic with views that eventually lead to spectacular vistas of Santa Marta and the ocean at the distance. You will just have to put up with the narrow, two-lane road, which is somewhat harrowing when traffic is coming from the other direction. The bonus is that the road is also paved in the last few years so that makes for an enjoyable trip.\nMinca\u2019s Transformation\nThe common question we are asked is, \u201cIs Minca safe?\u201d\u00a0 Minca was originally guerilla territory and was closed off to everyone, except locals. Following the ceasefire by the paramilitary and guerilla groups over the last several years, Minca was only recently \u2018discovered\u2019 by backpackers in the last eight years and was eventually opened up to host visitors. It\u2019s not just a place for backpackers either because it has something for everyone (even mid-life travelers like us). And the answer to your question, not once have we heard any issues or concerns about safety in Minca Magdalena.\n\nThings to do in Minca\nHiking\nNot only are there tonnes of things to do in Minca Colombia, there are ample hiking trails in the area. We decided to do the Los Pinos trail to get a whole perspective of the village and area. This is a three-hour (one way) hike uphill or a six-hour walk if you want to take this circular trail back to town that ends on the opposite end of the main street. To start this trail, exit the main street at the alternate direction past burger town, past the soccer fields, and further into the village. You will see waterfalls, birds, and forests on the way up. When you reach the cloud forest and the Dos Pinos or \u201cTwo Pines\u201d, you get a welcome view from the top of the Sierra Nevada mountains. We recommend taking the walk up, then relaxing at Casa Elemento (at the top), and take a moto-taxi down back to Minca. This will cut your trip down to three hours, plus the views are best on the way up.\n\nOne of many draw dropping views around Minca\n\n\nDiscover Minca\u2019s Interesting History\u00a0\nVisit Minca\u2019s museum and memorial center. (Centro de Memoria de la Sierra Nevada) Take a guided tour through this nonprofit center learn about its evolution from the armed conflict and political history, its importance as a coffee region and the indigenous groups of the Sierra Nevadas. Now rated the #1 for the \u00a0 things to do in Minca on Trip Advisor, check out the great reviews!\u00a0\n\nTravelers taking the guided tour of the museum\nRelax and spend the afternoon at Casa Elemento\nWhat more could you ask for? It has a restaurant, bar, pool, climbing wall and a giant hammock to hang over the mountain and contemplate on how great your life is while you look down at a stunning view of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This is our top Minca things to do thing. No doubt there will be other travelers from all over the world to hang out and join you. This an ideal place to chill out which takes your present-moment living to the next level. This place is a calming oasis. They also organize tours. \u00a0They charge a small the entrance fee, (at the time of booking it was 10,000 COP) and you can already spend the afternoon there to use their facilities or you can stay there! Check latest prices and availability here. \u00a0\nVisit La Victoria Coffee Farm\nEven if you\u2019ve had your fill of coffee farms by now, this tour is different. In fact, the place is the production facility and not an actual farm. (The coffee is in the hills surrounding the building) This is where their coffee is processed by traditional equipment and methods from the late 1800\u2019s and early 1900\u2019s. The delightful tour guides will be ready to take you through the buildings, and share some of the ingenious engineering methods they apply to produce modern-day coffee, using equipment that is a big step back in time.\nHang out in one of the many restaurants and caf\u00e9s\nAt the center of the village, there is also a couple of pool halls for travelers to drink and connect with the local village men. For such a small town there is no shortage of places to eat and drink. Here are some of the cool little hangout spots all over the town.\n\nGreat bar, restaurant and cafe close to the town center.\nOther honorable mentions of what to do in Minca Colombia include:\nBird watching\nThere are over 162 species of birds in the area of Minca, so it is not surprising that bird watching is an important pastime here. There are tours available to El Dorado and San Lorenzo trails or birdwatching areas. For three hours, it is around COP$25,000 ($8USD).\nPozo Azul Minca\nDid we mention that it\u2019s hot up in the Northern Caribbean? Although the Minca breeze is a welcome reprieve from Cartagena or Santa Marta, you may still want to cool down after a day of walking. Pozo Azul is a watering hole, not the drinking kind. On Sundays, it is full of local families, so we skipped this one. Who doesn\u2019t like a good place to have a cold, refreshing dip? The entrance to Pozo Azul Minca is free. One of the many local moto-taxi drivers would be more than happy to take you there for the afternoon. The cost is around 7000COP ($2.30USD) to get there from the main street.\u00a0\n\nSimple yet relaxing place to cool down and hang out \u2013 Pozo Azul\n\nPozo Azul Minca \u2013 Up close and personal with nature\nStrapped for time? Book a Day Trip to Minca\u00a0\nSometimes time really isn\u2019t on your side, you can book a daytrip or overnight from Santa Marta and have the whole day organized and planned for you, book on line and give yourself freedom with Get Your Guide.\n[tcb-script async=\u201d\u201d defer=\u201d\u201d src=\u201dhttps://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\u201d][/tcb-script]\nMap of Things to Do In Minca\n\nDetailed map of things to do in Minca\nWhere to Stay in Minca: \nThere is no shortage of places to stay in Minca Colombia and we\u2019ve stayed in a number of them now. Here are our favorites that are well worth it.\u00a0\n1) Casa Loma Minca Hostel\nMinca accomodation has grown big time! One of the popular spots is\u00a0Hostal Casa Loma Minca, an awesome part Minca hostel and a rustic cabin with both dorm and private rooms. We loved our stay in the Casa Selva room; it\u2019s like a tent cabin (or rustic forest hut, as they call it), with comfortable bed and a long lock box to protect your valuables. The dinners here are sensational \u2013 hearty vegetarian dishes like Vegetable Curry and Vegetarian Lasagna. Important note: It\u2019s a steep climb before you arrive at the Casa, so you may want to consider leaving all your gear in Santa Marta. But once you get there, you will witness some of the grandest views looking across the mountains. The cold beer at the top is worth it. There is a range of charming accommodations from dorms to tree cabins, and all reasonably priced. Check here for the prices and availability at Casa Loma\u00a0\n\nView of Santa Marta above from the viewpoint at Casa Loma\n\nOne of the many cool rooms \u2013 tent cabins at Casa Loma\u00a0\n2) Minca Ecohabs\nFor a little more pampering, Ecohabs Minca are stilted rustic cabins that are very tastefully decorated and with views overlooking the mountains. We toured the rooms and grounds for a future stay as we didn\u2019t book here. But these come highly recommended by tour companies we work with, and they seem open to negotiating room rates. Click here for prices and availability at Minca Ecohabs.\n\nThe cool cabins at Minca Ecohabs \u2013 many hang over a cliff with awesome views\n\n3) Casa Elemento Minca\nCasa Elemento really does have everything and its known for the biggest Colombian hammock overlooking Sierra Nevada Colombia. We\u2019ve eaten here and spent the day here. * Keep in mind, its way up the hill of the Sierra Nevada mountains so you will need to get transport to get there from the main street in town.There are many options for accommodations include dorms, cabanas, and hammocks, and now a newer set of cabanas all facing the mountain views. Check here for prices and availability at Casa Elemento\n\nCheck out this view from the \u00a0Casa Elemento Minca cabins\u00a0\n3)\u00a0Casa del Pozo Azul\u00a0\nThis is one of those places where you feel truly in nature and the jungle. It\u2019s just 2 km up the hill and right beside the Pozo Azul Minca watering hole. There are lovely accomodations surrounded by trees and a babbling river, its super serene and a true escape. \u00a0Check prices and availability here.\n\nCasa del Pozo Azul in the jungle\nRecommended Restaurants and Caf\u00e9s\u00a0\n1) Casa Elemento\nThis place is great not just for a brief retreat, but also a place to stop for excellent food. During our time there, our Canadian friend was the chef there, we hope the food is still as good as it was for us. Here is a photo of the shepard\u2019s pie and salad. \u00a0And you can stay there too! Check pricing and details here for Casa Elemento Minca.\u00a0\n\n2) Restaurant Santisabella\nThis is a really good \u00a0Italian food joint. The chef here has some classical training, which is evident in the thin crust pizza and fresh made pasta and lasagna. Be prepared to wait, as it is all made from scratch. You can find this place by heading to the police station; turn left head up the hill till you see this tree house-style spot on the left.\u00a0\n\n3) Burger Town\nThese are not fast food burgers. They are hand crafted, juicy, BBQ\u2019d burgers made by an Argentinian chef. The burgers come with fries on the side, as well as several choices of dipping sauces.\u00a0\n\n4) Caf\u00e9 de Minca\nWe had excellent cappuccinos, fresh juices and breakfast sandwiches here. It\u2019s also a store with artisan jewelry, as well as homemade hot sauces and condiments. This is the mainstay cafe in Minca.\n\n5) Cocina de Campo Caf\u00e9 and Hostel\nThis place is on the way to Pozo Azul and beside the entrance to Casa Pozo Azul. Its a simple and delicious place for Menu del dia, Almuerzo(lunch) and coffee. Its also a hostal and camping area, surrounded by the jungle.\n\nTraveling Around Minca\nThere is no shortage of friendly, eager, to young Minca men who would love to take you on a moto-taxi around Minca. Distances are a quite far, so it\u2019s worth the ride. We used moto-taxis to get back down from Casa Elemento and to travel up the hill to via Victoria Coffee Farm. Head to the main edge of town near the bridge to negotiate moto taxis and cabs.\u00a0\nHow To Get to Minca: \n\n1. First, you need to get to Santa Marta: \u00a0\nFrom Cartagena and Barranquilla, there are bus services to take you to Santa Marta. From Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn, or Cali, we would recommend taking local flights, which are reasonably priced ($40USD one way at this time of booking). VivaAir discount airlines have flights. Often, Avianca airlines has seat sales. If you are coming from the Airport in Santa Marta \u2013you can take the public bus for 1800COP with the bus marked \u2018Bonda\u2019 and head into the city to the central market.\nImportant Tip:\u00a0The airport is quite a long way from the main city center. We made the mistake of getting off too early, so make sure you get off at the Centro Mercado (the Central market). The next step to get to Minca from Santa Marta that is easy.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0How to get from Santa Marta Airport to Minca:\n \nFrom Santa Marta Airport to Minca you can get there are few ways:\u00a0\n\nCatch a \u201cprivate\u201d taxi for COP$44, 000-60,000 ($14USD-19USD) per car. A private car simply means you can leave when you want with however many people on board.\nCatch a collectivo or shared taxi on the corner of Calle 11 and Carrera 12 in Santa Marta at the market (El Mercado). These types of transport should cost around COP$7000 ($2.29USD) per person. The taxi will wait until there are four people before it leaves. As far as we know, there is no Santa Marta to Minca bus\nCatch a Moto-taxi \u2013 If you have only small items to carry (like a backpack) this is a good option. You can catch a moto-taxi from central Santa Marta for $COP 8000-10,000 ($2.60USD-$3.25USD).\n\nGiven Minca to Santa Marta is so close, you can do a day trip to Minca very easily, but we think you should stay at least one night and catch the vibe there.\nTo Get To Tayrona National Park from Minca, your guesthouse can arrange for a transport there or to Santa Marta. or walk down to the main street and negotiate with a taxi to take you down. At the time of our visit there was no Minca to Tayrona bus service.\u00a0\nAlternatively if you want to get from Cartagena to Minca, or Minca to Cartagena \u2013 the bus journey is about a 5 hour journey. It will stop in Baranquilla. A good choice is Berlinas bus company, there are frequent buses leaving from the Berlinas bus terminal and it should cost around 40,000 pesos (~$14 USD). Note there are several bus stations in Cartagena so you need to specify the name.\u00a0\nHeading up to Minca Santa Marta? then you MUST do the Lost City/Ciudad Perdida Hike,\u00a0 OR If that isn\u2019t for you, then check out our Tayrona National Park Videohere!\nStill planning your trip to Colombia? \u00a0\u2013 Check out our \u00a0comprehensive guide to Colombia here and all of our posts about Colombia here.\u00a0\u200b\nAnd we really appreciate readers who have gone to Minca Magdalena and want to give us their updates and opinions.
