Step 1
- input the queries - potentially have a query expander with the most common variants, especially if only doing restaurants 
- input the title/theme that then creates named output files
- start with putting the queries in a query.txt file then ask chat gpt how to create a simple UX for inputting the queries 
- [done] abstract the keys into a keys file similar to what we did for the banker 
- avoid picking up duplicate sites to improve efficiency of the parsing and content later 

Step 2
- [done] abstract keys  
- abstract naming of the json file 
- [done, need to test] update the parsing function for error handling
- let user select the model to use, maybe pull in from OpenAI list of models 
- enable adjustment of parameters, either by user or based on the model picked

Step 3 
- abstract file and tab name
